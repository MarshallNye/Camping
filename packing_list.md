# The Big Three
Generally speaking, the Big Three gear pieces of any backpacking trip consist of: your shelter, your sleeping system and your backpack.
## Shelter
For shelter most people come in at around 3 pounds. Notice we said “shelter” and not tent. Thousands of backpackers have moved away from tent camping to hammock camping. The ultralighters shave even more weight by using just a tarp and trekking poles. Those who want to do away with all privacy might even go without carrying anything. They rely on bunking in the wood and stone shelters that are scattered a day’s hike apart along most of our country’s long trails. That’s a risky undertaking if you arrive late and find there’s no room and it’s raining.

### Tents 
offer great privacy and solid shelter on all sides from rain, wind and in some cases, snow. They come with poles and stakes, and rainflies. The materials vary in composition and weight, so the weights for one- or two-person tents can vary pretty dramatically. Know this, the lighter the tent, the higher the cost.

### Hammock
Hammocks keep you off the hard or soggy ground, which is nice if you have a bad back or it’s raining. They set up quick, and in most places, trees are plentiful. A hammock by itself is way under 3 pounds, but once you factor in a rainfly, bug net and straps, you’re probably somewhere near the weight of a lightweight tent. However, keeping warm requires extra gear, such as an underquilt, and there are portions of some trails (the Pacific Crest Trail begins in the desert) where there are virtually no trees to hang from.

### Tarps
In addition, tarps can be incredibly light and versatile. In fact, they can be fashioned in a number of setups. If it’s windy and rainy, set it close to the ground. In hot weather, raise it to enjoy more air movement. Just remember, now you don’t have as much protection from mosquitos and critters that want to warm up next to you during the night.

## Sleep system
Most backpackers go the sleeping bag route. You can sleep on top of them on hot nights; you can get zipped up tight inside them with a hood in cold weather. Again, weight can vary from about 1 pound to 3 or more, depending on the insulation needed to reach the temperature rating you want. But you can find a reasonably priced sleeping bag good to temperatures near freezing that weigh less than 2 pounds.

Many hammock campers and others now use quilts instead of sleeping bags. Quilts generally don’t have an enclosed foot box, so they allow more freedom of movement and adapt well to temperature conditions.

If you are sleeping on the ground, your sleep system should include a sleeping pad to insulate you from the ground. These can weigh just a few ounces to more than 2 pounds.

## Backpack
The options are too numerous to go into in this post. If you have a lot of gear to haul, you want a large and stout backpack. There will be top lids, hefty straps and a sturdy internal or external frame. Keeping it under 3 pounds will be a tremendous challenge. But if you are a weight-conscious packer, there are many great backpacks in the 3- to 4-pound range with many great features.

Ultralighters, and that’s what most thru-hikers evolve into, will favor packs with few features, a lightweight or non-existent frame. They will be as light as 1.5 pounds. They are made of lightweight materials, so the entire pack weight should be well under 30 pounds.

# Clothing
* Wicking underwear, underarmor or otherwise 
* Wool socks 
* Cotton T Shirts
* Wool socks
* Broken-in boots or hiking shoes. You want something that will support your ankles, provides good grip, and won't cause blisters
* Pants that will not chafe, that you can be comfortable in all day long
* Belt, that won't pinch your waist while wearing a backpack
* A warm jacket, either something wool or down. 

# Personal Items

## Navigation
A printed map of the area, USGS Topo Map, or Gazeteer
### Compass (Orienteering vs Lensatic)
There are two major kinds of compasses, lensatic and orienteering. Both are suitable for most land navigation tasks, though I prefer to use a lensatic.

Compasses are something you need to practice with ahead of time, and often you only need one per group. I definitely recommend you have one if you are going somewhere solo.


## Headlamp
The evolution from the old L-shape flashlights. I prefer a headlamp that has both white and red light. Red light is great for preserving night vision, and is less awful for the others areound your camp site

## Knife
A small (<6") blade is generally all you need for basic outdoors work. 

## Scarf/Shemagh/Keffiyeh/
It's like a Thneed. Many, many uses. 

Dust Protection – Cover your face
Sun Protection – Great for when you’re stranded without shade.
Towel – Small, lightweight, fast drying, but thick enough get the job done.
Ground Cloth – Keep your butt clean & dry when sitting on the ground.
Warmth – Wrap it around your neck as a scarf to keep warm.
Bag – Put stuff in middle, tie corners together. Instant hobo sack.
Sarong – Wrap around your waist for modesty. Shorter than a normal one.
Sweat Rag – Great for hiking, running, or other sweat-inducing activities.
Arm Sling – Sprain a wrist or break an arm? Temporary immobilization.
Emergency Bandage – Help stop bleeding & protect the wound.
Pillow – Thick & soft enough to ball up & use for bus rides/camping trips.
Water Filter – Fold multiple times to filter debris out of water before boiling.
Pot Holder – Take that boiling water you just filtered off the fire!
Keeping Cool – Soak in cold water and wrap around your neck.
Signal Flag – Large enough to wave and get someone’s attention.
Blanket – Decent for covering some of your upper or lower body.
Eye Mask – Sleep during the day or in a hostel when lights are on.

## Water
You should carry 1 liter of water for every 2 hours of backpacking you have ahead of you. Of course, adjust this for your specific situation. Consider your age, the intensity of the hike, your personal sweat rate, body type, duration of the hike, the weather, and the distance.

Water obtained in the field requires processing, to prevent water bourne illness.

Boiling
Chemical Treatment
Filtering

## Rain Gear


## Radios
Not a necessity, but is good for if you need to wander away from camp in the middle of the night.

## Hygeine
* Toilet paper
* Toothbrush and toothpaste
* Menstrual and urinary products
