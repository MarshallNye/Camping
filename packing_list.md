# Shut Up and Tell Me What to Buy
Ok ok but you should really try these out in person at an REI or EMS, if possible.
## Sleeping Pad
### Therm-a-rest RidgeRest (Cheap)
Therm-a-rest is one of the oldest brands in the game. The RidgeRest is cheap ($30) and is bullet proof, but not very comfortable. It's an improvement over sleeping on the ground.

### Sea to Summit Pads (Mid Range)
I have had good experience with this brand. I have an older Comfort Plus pad, which I really like. Expect to pay between $90 to $160 depending on the variant. 

This pad is ~$100 for the regular size. It has a decent R-Value (2.6) and a reasonale weight.

### Therm-a-rest XTherm NeoAir ($$$)
Expensive, but extremely warm and light for the R-Value (6.9). Suitable for cold weather/winter camping. You may find you need far less sleeping bag with this, lest you overheat

## Sleeping Bags
### Snugpack Jungle Bag
Warm, light, roomy with an integrated bug net, this is great for summer trips. The bug net allows you to sleep with just a tarp for shelter without being eaten (by bugs) $70 on amazon

### Big Agnes Echo Park 40 (20 degree)
Warmer than the Jungle Bag, but heavier. Large open foot box, with room to spread around in. if you're an active sleeper, this is nice. $200
https://www.amazon.com/Big-Agnes-FireLine-Sleeping-Degree/dp/B081752V2D/ref=sr_1_2?crid=29Q3STAGFO52&dchild=1&keywords=big%2Bagnes%2Becho%2Bpark&qid=1623951841&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=big%2Bagnes%2Becho%2Csporting%2C148&sr=1-2&th=1

### Trail Quilts and Blankets
You can instead choose to bring blankets instead. The tradeoff is that you have much more flexibility with what you bring. 

Wool is warm, and retains it's insulative value when wet, at the cost of weight.

Synthetic Blankets are lighter, but at the cost of $$

## Shelter
### Snugpak Ionosphere
Single person tent, that doesn't require trees or trekking poles to setup. This is my preferred single person tent if there is a chance of rain
https://www.amazon.com/Snugpak-92850-Ionosphere-Person-Olive/dp/B00LWW9FMY/ref=pd_ybh_a_5?_encoding=UTF8&refRID=H2CR954WTZRRB5VPBT39&th=1

### Tarp
The most lightweight option, at the expense of greater exposure. Suggest that you combine this with a bug net of some kind. Requires trekking poles or trees to setup, which can make campsite selection tricky
A good size for shelter tarps is 10x10.
You can rock the traditional hardware store tarp, but it gets heavy

A SilNylon (Siliconized Nylon) tarp will be lighter and more durable, but at a higher price ~$100
https://www.amazon.com/Aqua-Quest-Guide-Tarp-Backpacking/dp/B07VBJXV1Y/ref=sr_1_3?crid=L3RYFBYT1ZWM&dchild=1&keywords=aqua%2Bquest%2Btarp%2B10x10&qid=1623952521&sprefix=10x10%2Btarp%2Baqua%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-3&th=1&psc=1

If you want to embrace your inner french canadian fur trapper, you can get an oilskin tarp. Heavy as shit, but pretty indestructible 
https://www.tentsmiths.com/product/oilskin-tarp/

Acturus makes a good emergency blanket/tarp combo. If you wanted to tarp camp, and want to do it on the cheap, buy this. ~$20
https://www.amazon.com/Arcturus-Heavy-Duty-Survival-Blanket/dp/B01H4VAKYS/ref=sr_1_5?crid=OYDI1MOAYFSW&dchild=1&keywords=arcturus+emergency+blanket&qid=1623952717&sprefix=emergency+blankets+arctu%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-5

# The Big Three
Generally speaking, the Big Three gear pieces of any backpacking trip consist of: your shelter, your sleeping system and your backpack.
## Shelter
For shelter most people come in at around 3 pounds. Notice we said “shelter” and not tent. Thousands of backpackers have moved away from tent camping to hammock camping. The ultralighters shave even more weight by using just a tarp and trekking poles. Those who want to do away with all privacy might even go without carrying anything. They rely on bunking in the wood and stone shelters that are scattered a day’s hike apart along most of our country’s long trails. That’s a risky undertaking if you arrive late and find there’s no room and it’s raining.

### Tents 
offer great privacy and solid shelter on all sides from rain, wind and in some cases, snow. They come with poles and stakes, and rainflies. The materials vary in composition and weight, so the weights for one- or two-person tents can vary pretty dramatically. Know this, the lighter the tent, the higher the cost.

### Hammock
Hammocks keep you off the hard or soggy ground, which is nice if you have a bad back or it’s raining. They set up quick, and in most places, trees are plentiful. A hammock by itself is way under 3 pounds, but once you factor in a rainfly, bug net and straps, you’re probably somewhere near the weight of a lightweight tent. However, keeping warm requires extra gear, such as an underquilt, and there are portions of some trails (the Pacific Crest Trail begins in the desert) where there are virtually no trees to hang from.

### Tarps
In addition, tarps can be incredibly light and versatile. In fact, they can be fashioned in a number of setups. If it’s windy and rainy, set it close to the ground. In hot weather, raise it to enjoy more air movement. Just remember, now you don’t have as much protection from mosquitos and critters that want to warm up next to you during the night.

## Sleep system
Most backpackers go the sleeping bag route. You can sleep on top of them on hot nights; you can get zipped up tight inside them with a hood in cold weather. Again, weight can vary from about 1 pound to 3 or more, depending on the insulation needed to reach the temperature rating you want. But you can find a reasonably priced sleeping bag good to temperatures near freezing that weigh less than 2 pounds.

Many hammock campers and others now use quilts instead of sleeping bags. Quilts generally don’t have an enclosed foot box, so they allow more freedom of movement and adapt well to temperature conditions.

If you are sleeping on the ground, your sleep system should include a sleeping pad to insulate you from the ground. These can weigh just a few ounces to more than 2 pounds.

## Backpack
The options are too numerous to go into in this post. If you have a lot of gear to haul, you want a large and stout backpack. There will be top lids, hefty straps and a sturdy internal or external frame. Keeping it under 3 pounds will be a tremendous challenge. But if you are a weight-conscious packer, there are many great backpacks in the 3- to 4-pound range with many great features.

Ultralighters, and that’s what most thru-hikers evolve into, will favor packs with few features, a lightweight or non-existent frame. They will be as light as 1.5 pounds. They are made of lightweight materials, so the entire pack weight should be well under 30 pounds.

# Clothing
Pack your clothing in either ziplock or water proofstuff sacks. 
* Wicking underwear, underarmor or otherwise 
* Wool socks, one pair for each day + a spare
* Cotton T Shirts
* Broken-in boots or hiking shoes. You want something that will support your ankles, provides good grip, and won't cause blisters
* Pants that will not chafe, that you can be comfortable in all day long
* Belt, that won't pinch your waist while wearing a backpack
* A warm jacket, either something wool or down. 

# Personal Items

## Navigation
A printed map of the area, USGS Topo Map, or Gazeteer. One per group is enough.

### Compass (Orienteering vs Lensatic)
There are two major kinds of compasses, lensatic and orienteering. Both are suitable for most land navigation tasks, though I prefer to use a lensatic. 
https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/navigation-basics.html
https://carnegiemnh.org/how-to-use-a-lensatic-compass/

Compasses are something you need to practice with ahead of time, and often you only need one per group. I definitely recommend you have one if you are going somewhere solo.


## Lights
I recommend you buy a headlamp. Even a cheap one is fine. I prefer a headlamp that has both white and red light. Red light is great for preserving night vision, and is less awful for the others areound your camp site.
https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-Headlamp-Flashlight-Camping-Outdoors/dp/B07PYMWPFH/ref=sr_1_10?crid=24KAFVTYR36AU&dchild=1&keywords=energizer+headlamp&qid=1624029888&sprefix=energizer+head%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-10

Don't bother with a lantern, unless you're planning on not having a fire.

## Knife
A small (<6") blade is generally all you need for basic outdoors work. 

## Scarf/Shemagh/Keffiyeh/
It's like a Thneed. Many, many uses. Bring one.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JUXAFQ?pf_rd_r=EF7CGJPQHTPVS2BGDA6K&pf_rd_p=5ae2c7f8-e0c6-4f35-9071-dc3240e894a8&pd_rd_r=a5a5cfb7-423e-41ad-ad9d-5b908eb99340&pd_rd_w=vpmoW&pd_rd_wg=QLf2m&ref_=pd_gw_unk

Dust Protection – Cover your face
Sun Protection – Great for when you’re stranded without shade.
Towel – Small, lightweight, fast drying, but thick enough get the job done.
Ground Cloth – Keep your butt clean & dry when sitting on the ground.
Warmth – Wrap it around your neck as a scarf to keep warm.
Bag – Put stuff in middle, tie corners together. Instant hobo sack.
Sarong – Wrap around your waist for modesty. Shorter than a normal one.
Sweat Rag – Great for hiking, running, or other sweat-inducing activities.
Arm Sling – Sprain a wrist or break an arm? Temporary immobilization.
Emergency Bandage – Help stop bleeding & protect the wound.
Pillow – Thick & soft enough to ball up & use for bus rides/camping trips.
Water Filter – Fold multiple times to filter debris out of water before boiling.
Pot Holder – Take that boiling water you just filtered off the fire!
Keeping Cool – Soak in cold water and wrap around your neck.
Signal Flag – Large enough to wave and get someone’s attention.
Blanket – Decent for covering some of your upper or lower body.
Eye Mask – Sleep during the day or in a hostel when lights are on.

## Water
You should carry 1 liter of water for every 2 hours of backpacking you have ahead of you. Of course, adjust this for your specific situation. Consider your age, the intensity of the hike, your personal sweat rate, body type, duration of the hike, the weather, and the distance.

Water obtained in the field requires processing, to prevent water bourne illness.

I like single wall metal canteens (because I can boil water in them), but really and plastic water bottle you have is fine.

Camelbaks and other water bladders are a fine choice, if your backpack accomodates them.

## Water Filtration
Making this it's own category. I bring water filtration with me that can supply water to the group, so don't worry about this
### Boiling
Tried and true. Will kill any bugs in the water, but will not remove contaminants. Jet Boils are the defacto water boiler for most hikers, but a tin can and a fire works 

### Chemical Treatment
Usually as a backup if you cannot boil or filter water. Usually gives water an unpleasant taste, but kills bugs. Does not remove contaminants. 

### Filtering
The preferred way to go, will filter out bugs, but also can remove some contaminants.

### Distillation
You really don't see this in the field, but is a reliable way to purify water.

## Rain Gear
If you aren't expecting weather, a cheap poncho is enough for a surprise rain shower. Otherwise a jacket with a waterproof shell is a good option. Remember you'll need to find shelter for your gear as well!

## Radios
Not a necessity, but is good for if you need to wander away from camp in the middle of the night.

## Hygeine
* Toilet paper
* Toothbrush and toothpaste
* Menstrual and urinary products
* Prescription medications
* A small ziplock bag to store used products, if you are not going to bury/burn them

I bring a small bottle of biodegradeable soap, so don't worry about packing it.

## Small Fire Kit
I'll go over how to make a fire, and what's in my kit. Don't worry about packing this.

## Wood processing
I like collapsable saws.

## Cooking Supplies
Bring a cup or mug. Preferrably a collapsing style camp mug.
