# PREPARE GROUND TEAM INDIVIDUAL EQUIPMENT
## ## CONDITIONS
You are a member of a ground team at home prior to a mission.
## OBJECTIVE
Collect and efficiently pack all items required of a ground team member. The enclosed list is the suggested
national list. Wings may have supplemented this list to suit their environment with national approval, so be sure
to use your approved wing list.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Your individual equipment is designed to keep you functional in the field and to help you do your job.
 a. Equipment is divided into two parts -- the 24-hour pack for short activities (typical field gear) and the
72 hour pack for longer duration activities (typically called base gear). This gear list was derived from the gear
lists suggested by several CAP wings and other organizations including the National Association for Search and
Rescue (NASAR), and modified to meet CAP needs.
 1) The 24 hour pack is what you carry while searching. As its name infers, in case of an
emergency, this equipment will help you survive in the wilderness for 24 hours. In addition, your 24 hour pack
is part of your uniform -- when the public sees you on a mission, they will probably see you wearing your field
gear. Because of this, your 24 hour pack must present a professional uniform appearance. Though packs do not
need to be identical, it is advantageous for unit members to have similar 24-hour packs. Every ground team
member will have this equipment.
 2) The extended duration pack is designed to help you live in the field for more than one day,
typically 48 to 72 hours. It includes your sleeping bag, tent, and other long term comfort items. The extended
duration is not subject to uniformity -- color and size does not matter. The major constraint is how much you
can carry. Even if the mission is only expected to last one day, you should always bring your base gear. You
never know how long a mission will last, or whether you will go straight to another mission from the current
one.
 b. For your equipment to be effective, you must insure it is clean and serviceable. Occasionally you
will have to replace items such as medicine, batteries or food because it has passed its expiration date.
 c. You must be able to carry all your equipment at once, in case you must “hike in” to a mission base.
Normally, this means leaving room in your base gear pack to stow all of your field gear.
 d. Ensure your gear is properly secured -- nothing should be flapping loose where it could snag in the
brush or bang against your body when moving.
 e. Restrictions on Knives: You may only wear a sheath knife if authorized by your team leader. Sheath
knives cannot have a blade longer than 6” or a total length of greater than 11”. The sheath must adequately
secure the knife and protect the wearer from the blade. If authorized, sheath knives will be worn only on the
pistol belt or carried inside the pack. The following knife types are not authorized: boot knives, butterfly
knives, switch blades, double edged knives, “Rambo” style survival knives, or knives with retracting sheaths.
Machetes or hatchets can only be carried by senior members when needed for that specific sortie. No knives
may be visible when the member is performing crash sight surveillance duty. 
2. The gear list below is the minimum required equipment. Items required of trainees are marked with a “T."
You may carry additional equipment subject to team leader approval and your ability to secure and carry it --
remember, you may have to walk a long way carrying it all.

CONDUCT INDIVIDUAL REFIT
## CONDITIONS
You are a ground team member who has just completed a sortie or has returned home following a mission.
OJECTIVES
Correctly identify and explain the steps to be taken to prepare yourself for the next sortie or mission, using the
“4 R’s”.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. The minute a sortie or mission is completed, a team member should prepare for the next sortie or mission.
This means taking care of your equipment and yourself. There is a great temptation after a hard day in the field
to not worry about your equipment for a while. But on a mission, you must be prepared to leave on another
sortie at a moment’s notice. Even when the mission is complete, you may be alerted for another mission within
hours -- it happens!
2. As soon as you complete a sortie or mission, perform the following steps, known as the “4 R’s”:
 a. REPLENISH
 1) After a sortie, ensure you still have all required equipment. If something is missing, see if a
team mate has a spare. If not, inform your team leader. He or she might be able to arrange for you to purchase
the item before the next sortie. Also replenish anything you used, especially food and water. Don’t be caught
without a meal in your field gear and full canteens. Also check things like flashlight batteries, medical supplies,
matches, etc. These items can expire, be used up, or (for medical supplies) be damaged and no longer sterile.
Inform your team leader if you need certain supplies replenished.
 2) After a mission, purchase any replacements you need.
 b. REPAIR
 1) After a sortie, this means inspecting all your equipment to see what is broken, and making
what field repairs you can. This includes repairing rips in clothing, patching holes in ponchos or tents with duct
tape, etc. Make the repair now, before you need to use that item. Remove mud from boots, and polish them to
maintain water resistance.
 2) After a mission, this also means cleaning uniforms and other items. Dirty clothing and
sleeping bags do not insulate well. Wet tents can mildew -- set them up and dry them out. Air out your
sleeping bag.
 c. REPACK -- after the above steps, repack your gear so you can move out at a moment’s notice.
Don’t be caught with your equipment spread throughout the house (or your tent at mission base) when the call
to move occurs.
 d. REST - AFTER you have prepared your gear for the next mission or sortie, get a well-deserved rest.
The next sortie or mission could happen at night. 
O-0002 31-JAN-01
3. Your team leader may also make you responsible for team equipment. Make sure that equipment gets
REPLENISHED, REPAIRED, and REPACKED as well before you REST.

PREVENT AND TREAT HOT WEATHER INJURIES
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a ground team on a mission during on a hot day. Members of your team begin to exhibit
symptoms of heat-related injuries.
OJECTIVES
Take steps to prevent hot weather injuries and recognize and treat those that do occur.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Heat injuries (sometimes called heat stress) are the result of overexertion and dehydration. These ## CONDITIONS
can occur at any time during the year, but are most common during the summer months with high temperatures
and humidity.
2. To prevent heat stress:
 a. Ensure you are drinking enough water per day. Two quarts per day is the absolute minimum on a
mild day. On a hot summer day, drink 6-8 quarts a day or 1 quart an hour. Frequent sipping is better than
trying to drink an entire quart at a time.
 b. Monitor the color of your urine. It should be almost clear in color. If it is brown or dark yellow, you
are becoming dehydrated.
 c. Wear loose fitting and open clothing.
 d. Do not overexert yourself. Know your limits and do not exceed them. Take frequent breaks.
 e. Avoid sunburn by using sunscreen or keeping your sleeves down.
 f. Watch other members of the team for beginning signs of heat stress. Immediately stop, rest and drink
some water. Once a person succumbs to a heat injury, he will not be back for the rest of the day.
 g. Use the buddy system -- assign everyone a partner to watch for heat stress and to monitor water
intake.
3. There are three major types of heat injuries: heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.
 a. Heat cramps are usually the first stage of heat stress. They are the result of dehydration and loss of
electrolytes in body tissues.
 1). Symptom of heat cramps:
 a) Severe muscle cramps, usually in the legs and abdomen. 
O-0003 31-JAN-01
 b) General Weakness
 c) Sometimes dizziness and faintness.
 2) Treatment of heat cramps:
 a) Move the patient to a cool, shady place.
 b) Provide salted water or a commercial electrolyte (i.e. Gatorade).
 c) Massage the cramped area.
 d) Apply some pressure to the cramped area, but stop if it makes the patient more
uncomfortable.
 e) Apply moist towels to the patient’s forehead and the cramped muscle.
 f) If symptoms worsen, immediately transport the person to a medical care facility.
 b. Heat exhaustion is the next phase of heat stress (although some individuals may never develop heat
cramps before going into heat exhaustion).
 1). Symptoms of heat exhaustion:
 a) Rapid and shallow breathing.
 b) Weak pulse.
 c) Cold and clammy skin.
 d) Heavy perspiration
 e) Weakness and dizziness that may lead to unconsciousness
 2) Treatment of heat exhaustion:
 a) Move the patient to a cool, shady place and keep him at rest.
 b) Remove enough clothing to cool (not chill) the patient.
 c) Fan the patient’s skin to promote sweat evaporation.

 d) If the patient is conscious, provide salted water or a commercial electrolyte (i.e.
Gatorade).
 e) Treat for shock and transport the patient to a medical care facility.
 c. Heat Stroke is the final phase of heat stress. It is a life-threatening condition. It is the result of the
body’s absolute failure to regulate heat, and as a result the bodies core temperature starts to rise (hyperthermia). 
O-0003 31-JAN-01
This leads to the rapid destruction of body tissues and brain cells. Permanent brain damage and death are
possible outcomes of heat stroke. Even if successfully treated, it will take days for the patient to recover.
 1) Symptoms of heat stroke:
 a) Deep breathing becoming progressively shallower.
 b) A rapid, strong pulse becoming weaker.
 c) Dry and hot skin
 d) Dilated pupils.
 e) Possible unconsciousness, seizures, and muscular twitching.
 2) Treatment of heat stroke. The key is to cool the patient as rapidly as possible.
 a) Remove the person from any heat sources and remove clothing.
 b) If possible immerse the patient in cool water, or use cold wet towels or ice packs in the
patient’s armpits, groin, under neck and behind knees..
 c) Treat for shock and transport the patient to a medical care facility.

PREVENT AND TREAT COLD WEATHER INJURIES
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a ground team on a mission during on a cold day. Members of your team begin to exhibit
symptoms of cold-related injuries.
OJECTIVES
Take steps to prevent cold weather injuries and recognize and treat those that do occur
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. You are part of a ground team on a mission during on a cold day. Members of your team begin to exhibit
symptoms of cold-related injuries. In order to continue your mission, you must treat these injuries and prevent
them from happening again.
2. Cold injuries are a result of unstopped cooling of body parts of the whole body. To prevent cold weather
injuries, it is essential to remain warm and dry. If the skin is wet, it will lose heat twenty times faster than if it is
dry. People who have had cold weather injuries in the past are more likely to have them again.
3. To avoid cold weather injuries.
 a. Cover all extremities by using gloves, wool socks and a knit hat or hood over your ears.
 b. Use the layer principle -- several loose layers of clothing keep a person warmer than one bulky item
of clothing. The multiple layers trap warm air pockets, which help maintain a uniform body temperature. As
you exert yourself and begin heating up, remove layers as needed. Put them back on as you cool down. Layers
can include underwear, socks, thermal underwear, sweater or sweatshirt, uniform, field jacket liner, field jacket,
knit hat, glove liners and gloves.
 c. Choose clothing that will trap air pockets yet allow moisture to pass through. Wool, polypropylene
and Gore-Tex are good fabric choices that remain warm when wet. Rubber or vinyl coats are extremely bad, as
they hold the body’s moisture in.
 d. Avoid getting wet, especially your feet. Stay out of streams and muddy places.
 e. Avoid overexertion that could cause you to sweat.
 f. Identify all personnel in your team who have a history of cold weather injuries, and watch them
carefully.
 g. Change clothing when it is dirty or wet, especially socks.
 h. Use the buddy system -- assign each person a partner. Each pair watches each other for signs of cold
weather injuries. 
O-0004 31-JAN-01
4. The main cold weather injuries of concern to ground teams are frostbite and hypothermia.
 a. Frostbite occurs in the body extremities (fingers, toes, feet, hands, tip of nose and ears) when the
body part is exposed to intensely cold air or liquid. Freezing of the affected area begins and ice crystals begin
forming in the skin. In severe cases, the body tissue dies and gangrene sets in, leading to the loss of the body
part. Frostbite usually takes time to develop, but most people are unaware that it has begun. Frostbite occurs in
two stages that have different treatments:
 1) Early Stage of Frostbite:
 a) Symptoms:
 (1) Skin turns from red to white and waxy.
 (2) Numbness in the affected area

 b) Treatment: Warm the affected area using body heat. Hands and feet can be placed in
another team member’s armpit for warmth. Patient will probably sense tingling or burning in the affected area
as it is re-warmed. DO NOT MASSAGE A FROSTBITTEN BODY PART.
 2) Later Stage of Frostbite (if early stage is not treated)
 a) Symptoms: Skin turns mottled or blotchy, yellow, and finally greyish-blue
 b) Treatment:
 (1) Transport the patient to medical care immediately.
 (2) If transport is not immediately available, immerse the affected area in warm
(not hot) water until circulation and re-warming occur. Do not let the affected part touch the sides of the
container the body part is immersed in. DO NOT MASSAGE A FROSTBITTEN BODY PART.
 b. Hypothermia is the systemic cooling of the entire body. The body’s core temperature falls below
average and starts affecting the body’s circulatory system. Like frostbite, hypothermia has two stages that
require different treatments:
 1) Early Stage of Hypothermia:
 a) Symptoms:
 (1) Uncontrollable shivering.
 (2) Numbness.
 .
 b) Treatment:
 (1) Keep the patient warm and dry.
 (2) Remove wet clothing. 
O-0004 31-JAN-01
 (3) Warm the central body before the extremities, to keep blood from flowing
away from the major organs. If available, place hot packs on the neck, in the armpits, and in the groin.
 2) Later Stage of Hypothermia (if early stage is not treated)
 a) Symptoms:
 (1) Drowsiness, inability to perform simple actions.
 (2) Slow pulse and breathing rate.
 (3) Failing eyesight and a “glassy stare.".
 (4) Finally, unconsciousness
 b) Treatment:
 (1) All treatment steps for early hypothermia
 (2) Handle the patient gently, and place in a head-down position.
 (3) Transport the patient to medical care immediately.

INSPECT TEAM MEMBERS
## CONDITIONS
You are a team leader, and your team is about to depart for a sortie.
## OBJECTIVE
Inspect your team members for appearance, safety, and mission readiness.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. It is the team leader’s responsibility to ensure his personnel are equipped to perform their job safety and
effectively. Although gear purchase is an individual’s responsibility, the team leader has the authority to restrict
any team member from participating because of uniform or equipment problems. A team member missing
critical items, or with unserviceable equipment, might be unsafe, become a burden to his team, or an
embarrassment to the Civil Air Patrol.
 a. Inspections in the field cannot be as lengthy as a full gear layout (see tasks O-0001 and O-0010).
Instead the leader should only inspect those critical items necessary for the performance of the mission, the
member’s safety, and his appearance.
 b. Asking a team member if he is carrying a meal is not an inspection. The leader should ask to see the
thing he is inspecting. This eliminates misunderstandings, or memory errors
2. The best way to inspect a unit is to line them up, and announce what items you are going to inspect. That
way, they can get the items out before you get to them, which speeds the process up
3. As you inspect, you check each item for serviceability. Having a flashlight is good. Having a working
flashlight much better. Don’t assume that compasses point to north, that canteens are full, or that medication is
not four years old and stale. Check these things.
4. Utilize the published minimum equipment list to complete the following inspection checklist:
 a. Safety -
 1) Adequate clothing, food and water. (remember to check orange vests for ground teams and
appropriate uniforms for UDF team members)
 2) Documentation for any allergies or medical problems? Any medication he needs.
 3) Adequate survival equipment in case he gets lost.
 4) Is the member overloaded?
 5) Is the member sick or fatigued?
 b. Mission readiness. 
O-0005 17-MAR-04
 1) The equipment needed for this mission (for example, a flashlight and extra batteries for night
work, or marking tape for line searches).
 2) Is all equipment secured on the person, without excess straps hanging off? Is the person’s
load balanced for hiking?
 3) Current CAP ID Card, CAPF 101, first aid card, communications certification, State Driver’s
license and CAP driver’s license (if applicable).
 c. Appearance.
 1) Is the member in a complete, clean and serviceable uniform?
 2) Has he shaved, washed, etc.?
5. If you find problems, you have to decide how to deal with them. For example, you might be able to find a
meal for a team member who doesn’t have one. You might not let the team member with an unsightly
uniform man a crash site surveillance post in full view of the public, but perhaps he could monitor the radio
in the vehicle. But if it is a safety issue, it is your responsibility not to let the team member participate
where he could be injured.

INSPECT TEAM EQUIPMENT
## CONDITIONS
You are a team leader, and your team is about to depart for a sortie.
## OBJECTIVE
Inspect your team equipment for appearance, safety, and mission readiness.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Prior to departing for mission base, you should inspect your team’s equipment. This inspection is conducted
to ensure that all required team equipment is present and functioning properly. This is especially important for
team gear:
 a. Utilize the team equipment list provided by your wing to assess your team's equipment capability.
 b. As you perform the inspection, check for the serviceability of items. Make sure items work by
testing them. If the distress beacon Direction Finder has no batteries, it is worthless. Make sure you check
team radios to make sure they can transmit and receive.
2. To perform an inspection,
 a) Announce what you are inspecting, and have your team get the items out ahead of time. For
example, if you have two vehicles and you are checking fire extinguishers, have the drivers pull the
extinguishers out and show them to you.
 b) Make sure you see the items yourself. Don’t just ask someone if they have something. They could
make a mistake, or not know that someone else has taken or broken the item.
 c) Determine what equipment is mission critical, and pay special attention to it. For example: maps of
the search area, the distress beacon DF for aircraft searches, etc.
 d) Inspect for accountability and serviceability - do you have it, and does it work.
 e) Use the following checklist, or your wing's equipment list.

DIRECT TEAM REFIT AFTER SORTIE
## CONDITIONS
You are a ground team leader of a team that has just completed a sortie and returned to mission base.
## OBJECTIVES
Correctly identify and explain the steps taken to prepare yourself for the next sortie or mission, using the “4 R’s”:
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. The minute a sortie is completed, the team must begin preparing for the next sortie. This means taking care
of team equipment, individual equipment, and team members’ personal needs. There is a great temptation after
a hard day in the field to not worry about your equipment for a while. But on a mission, you must be prepared
to leave on another sortie at a moment’s notice. As team leader, you must direct refit actions, and inspect to
ensure these actions are completed.
2. As soon as you complete a sortie or mission, while you are going to debrief, you should direct your team to
begin refit according to the “4 R’s”. Each person refits their individual gear. You should assign individuals to
refit items of team gear. Give specific tasks to specific people - don’t assume “somebody will do it”.
 a. REPLENISH - Replacing lost or used up items.
 1) Team Equipment: After a sortie, ensure you still have all required equipment. Use your
copy of the Ground Team Resource form to inventory team gear. If something is missing, see if another team
has a spare. Refill water cans, check batteries, fuel vehicles, replace medical supplies, etc. Make a list of those
items you need to purchase or acquire.
 2) Individual equipment - Each person checks their own equipment, fills canteens, puts a new
meal in their field gear etc. They should inform you of items they have lost, or cannot replenish.
 b. REPAIR - inspecting items for serviceability and making what field repairs you can.
 1) Team Equipment - check any item you used. Clean vehicle windows and headlights.
 2) Individual Equipment. This includes repairing rips in clothing, patching holes in ponchos or
tents with duct tape, etc. Remove mud from boots, and polish them to maintain water resistance.
 c. REPACK - after the above steps, repack your team and individual gear so you can move out at a
moment’s notice. Don’t be caught with your equipment spread throughout the house (or your tent at mission
base) when the call to move occurs.
 d. REST - AFTER you have inspected your team to make sure refit is complete, ensure they are resting.
The next sortie or mission could happen at night. Keep track of where your team members are, so you can
assemble them quickly when needed.

IDENTIFY NATURAL HAZARDS
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a ground team moving through the wilderness.
OJECTIVES
Recognize and avoid the various types of natural hazards.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
There are three categories of natural hazards: terrain, plants and animals.
1. Terrain
 a. Cliffs and steep terrain. These can often be identified on maps by closely spaced contour lines.
Choose routes around these features. If you must search the area, search parallel to the slope, rather than
climbing or descending it.
 b. Drainage and flood areas. These are sometimes marked on maps. Avoid moving through these areas.
If the search requires you, ensure your team is properly dressed, and exercise extreme care.
 c. Rough terrain, such as boulder fields. You will often have to search through these areas. Slow your
rate of movement to allow all team members to exercise proper caution.
2. Plants. Search teams can avoid most poisonous plants simply by not eating any berries or wild plants.
There are, however, “irritant” plants that can affect team members who touch them. All three can cause an
irritating rash that may take one to three days to develop.
 a. There are three irritant plants -- poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac:
 1) Poison ivy is an irritant vine that grows close to the ground and along the trunks of trees. The
vine has green almond shaped leaves in sets of three, and is prevalent in the spring through the fall. 
O-0101 31-JAN-01
 2) Poison oak is very similar to poison ivy, with green, three leafed vines. However the leaves
are broader and flatter.
 3) Poison sumac is a similar plant, but the leaves can come in sets of nine to ten or more and
there are small red berries attached to the plants.
 b. To avoid exposure to these plants:
 1) Cover exposed skin when in the woods (long sleeves, gloves, etc.).
 2) Do not handle any plants or vines unnecessarily.
 3) To avoid poison ivy and oak, remember the adage “IF LEAVES ARE THREE, LET THIS
PLANT BE.”
 4) If you are exposed to one of these plants, wash the affected area thoroughly to remove any
resin from the plant on the skin. If you have resin on your clothes, change them as well.
3. Animals. Ground teams avoid any animals in wilderness areas.
 a. There are certain animals that do represent a direct hazard to humans who disturb them.
 1) Rodents. Raccoons, skunks, squirrels, rats and possums fall into this category. The main
danger from these animals is that they carry rabies. In addition, skunks will use its scent sprayer if cornered.
 a) Identification: All are four legged, small and furry. Skunks are black with a white
stripe down the length of their backs.
 b) Avoidance:
 (1) Do not put you hands or feet under logs or into holes where these animals may
have nests.
 (2) Give all small, furry animals a wide berth. Do not attempt to pet, feed or
provoke any animal in its own habitat.
 2) Insects. Bees, wasps, mosquitoes, and fire ants are stinging insects that tend to plague
searchers in the wilderness. To avoid these insects :
 a) Be watchful for bees’ and wasps’ nests and fire ant hills, and do not disturb them.
 b) Dispose of trash properly to avoid attracting insects.
 c) If you are allergic to bees stings, carry your medication and ensure everyone on your
team is aware of your condition and where your medication is.
 d) The only way to avoid mosquitoes is with an appropriate insect repellent. Apply
repellent to all areas of exposed skin, especially around wrists, ankles, arms, legs and neck. Do not spray
repellent directly on your face; instead spray it on your hands and rub it on your face. Be careful with repellent
on your forehead - sweat can make it drip into your eyes. You can spray repellent to the brim of your hat
instead of your forehead. 
O-0101 31-JAN-01
 Fire Ant Honey/Bumble Bee Wasp
 3) Spiders. Spiders tend to be more of a nuisance than a danger. Only two spiders in North
America are considered poisonous - the Black Widow and the Brown Recluse. The bite of either of these
spiders is painful but rarely fatal. Approximately 5% of the population will have an allergic reaction to the bite
and a few people may develop shock. Hypersensitive people will develop anaphylactic shock that can become
life threatening.
 a) Identification: The black widow is a ground dwelling spider found mostly in the
Western United States. It is black with a yellow-orange hourglass marking on its underside. The brown recluse
another ground dwelling spider. It is furry and brown, with a dark fiddle-shape mark on it’s back right between
the eyes.
Identification of Brown Recluse and Black Widow.
 b) Avoidance: 
O-0101 31-JAN-01
 (1) Don’t put your hands anywhere you haven’t looked first.
 (2) Avoid contact with all spiders.
 4) Snakes. Approximately 50,000 people per year are bitten by snakes in the US, with poisonous
snakes accounting for 15% of these bites. Even with over 7,500 poisonous snake bites per year, fewer than 10
people die per year (less than the number from bee and wasp stings). There are two kinds of poisonous snakes
in the US: pit vipers and neurotoxic snakes. Pit vipers are distinguished by the small pit in the snake’s head
directly between the eyes. This pit is essentially a heat sensor that the snake uses to find warm-blooded
creatures. Pit vipers have long fangs, that are used to bite and inject poison into the victim. The poison is
carried by the blood to other body tissues. Neurotoxic snakes are similar, but their poison affects the nervous
system rather than the blood stream.
 a) Identification. In the US, there are three common types of pit vipers (water moccasins,
rattlesnakes, and copperheads) and one neurotoxic snake (coral snake):
 (1) Water Moccasins. Water moccasins are dark snakes often called
cottonmouths because of the bright white interior of their mouths when fully opened. They are usually found in
lakes, ponds, swamps, and rivers.
Cottonmouth / Water Moccasin
 (2) Rattlesnakes. Rattlesnakes are usually dark or brown snakes noted for the
rattle on the tail. The rattle is used to distract prey or as a warning when the snake is cornered. It can be easily
heard when you get close to the snake. They are also known as diamondbacks because of the colored patterns
formed on their backs.
Canebreak Rattlesnake Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake Pigmy Rattlesnake
 (3) Copperheads. Copperheads are brown-orange in color with alternating bands
of color along their backs. Frequently, a strong “cucumber” smell is noted in the area. 
O-0101 31-JAN-01

Copperhead Snake Copperhead Snake Closeup

 (4) Coral Snakes. Coral snakes are small, with alternating black and red-orange
bands along their length, separated by thin yellow bands. Its mouth is small, usually only wide enough to bite
on a finger or a two.
Coral Snake
b) Avoidance:

 (1) Avoid putting your hands and feet anywhere you haven’t visually inspected,
especially holes or under rocks and logs.
 (2) Wear leather boots and gloves.

PREVENT AND TREAT FATIGUE
## CONDITIONS
Given a scenario in which the individual has been operating in the field for some time.
OJECTIVES
Recognize and react to fatigue symptoms in yourself and others.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Search and rescue operations are frequently conducted in adverse weather and terrain ## CONDITIONS and at
night. These are all ## CONDITIONS that will accelerate fatigue in individual team members and leaders. At a
minimum, team member fatigue results in reduced search effectiveness due to a lack of concentration. More
serious results are endangering yourself and others in the field. Vehicle operators are especially susceptible to
fatigue, sometimes with tragic results. The chances of field injuries are also greatly increased.
2. Fatigue symptoms should be recognized by all team members. Recognize them in yourself and others so that
you know when you have to stop and rest. Some symptoms are:
 a. Inability to concentrate.
 b. Slurring words, incomplete sentences and speech patterns.
 c. 'Bloodshot' eyes and haggard expressions
 d. Inability to walk properly.
 e. Drooping eyelids.
 f. False energy or 'slap happiness'.
Individuals showing these signs are ineffective as searchers and represent dangers to themselves and other
3. Ways of preventing or relieving fatigue are:
 a. Taking frequent breaks or catnaps when not on duty.
 b. Eating light snacks through the day.
 c. Changing seating arrangements in vehicles regularly.
 d. Ensuring that team members sleep for as long as possible during the night or when off duty (at least 6
to 8 hours per night).
 e. Eating complete meals and ensuring adequate water intake.
 f. Sit, lay down, rest, sleep whenever possible. 
O-0102 31-JAN-01
 g. Do not engage in unnecessary physical activity when waiting for an assignment.
 h. Use the buddy system - assign members in pairs. Each member of the pair watches the other for
signs of fatigue.
 i. If a member of the team shows signs of fatigue, take them off duty and allow them to rest until they
can be effective searchers.

CONDUCT FIELD SANITATION AND HYGIENE
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a ground team on an extended mission in the field.
OJECTIVES
Throughout the mission, take measures for:
1. Care of the feet.
2. Avoiding unpurified water.
3. Proper disposal of waste.
4. Proper personal hygiene.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Proper field sanitation and hygiene will keep you and your team healthy while living and working in the
field. If you become sick or injured, you are incapable of doing your job and become a burden on your team.
2. Taking Care of the Feet. As a ground team member, your feet are your primary mode of transportation. If
they are not functioning, you cannot function. While anyone can walk in the woods for a while, extended
operations require you to actively take care of your feet.
 a. Before Movement.
 1) Make sure your boots are correctly fitted and broken in. Do not wear new boots to the field.
 2) Make sure your socks are clean, fitted, and free of holes and knotty darns that might rub your
foot raw. Always bring extra socks and foot powder.
 3) Treat and protect blisters, pressure spots and infections before each sortie.
 b. During Movement.
 1) Keep your feet as dry as possible. Never walk in water or mud if you can avoid it. It takes
days for boots to dry out fully.
 2) Change damp or dirty socks as soon as possible.
 3) Dust your feet with foot powder to keep them dry. 
O-0103 31-JAN-01
 4) If your feet begin to bother your, adjust your socks and boot lacing to relieve pressure on
sensitive spots.
 c. Blisters. If you get a blister, clean it with soap and water. Watch for signs of redness, throbbing and
drainage. If this occurs, seek medical treatment.
2. Avoid unpurified water, Only drink and fill canteens from known pure water, such as from a faucet.
Anything else can make you very sick. Avoid all streams and lake water. If you must purify water, get your
team leader’s approval and follow the instructions on whatever water purification chemicals you use (NOTE:
This is as a last resort only).
3. Waste Disposal. One of the quickest ways to make you and your team sick is to improperly dispose of
garbage or human waste. If this material ends up in someone’s food or water, in can incapacitate everyone who
ingests it. In addition, waste can draw disease carrying insects and wild animals.
 a. Human Waste. Whenever possible, use bathrooms/latrines. If none are available, then dig a “cat
hole” at least one foot deep. Make sure the hole is at least 100 yards down wind from any bivouac site. Also
make sure your hole is not uphill from the bivouac to avoid drainage problems. After use, fill the hole back in.
 b. Garbage. Only put garbage in designated trash cans and bags. If none are available, seal your
garbage in plastic bags and pack it out of the field.
 c. Cooking Gear. If you use reusable utensils, mess kits, canteen cups, etc., wash then with hot water
and soap after each use.
4. Personal Hygiene:
 a. Brush your teeth at least once a day, preferable after every meal.
 b. Whenever water is available, wash your hands after using the latrine and before every meal.

SETUP SHELTER
## CONDITIONS
You are a member of a ground team required to spend the night in the field. You have your field and base gear
with you.
OJECTIVES
Setup a shelter considering the terrain and weather within 30 minutes.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Protecting yourself from the elements when remaining overnight in the wilderness should be a primary
concern. The shelter should be placed and constructed to protect you from wind, water, and ground obstacles.
Taking the time to ensure that you will have a relatively comfortable night's sleep will make you more alert and
efficient for the next day's activities.
2. Shelter site preparation
 a. Clear the entire area under the shelter to the bare ground. Remove any rocks, pebbles, branches or
roots in the area. If they cannot be removed, find another site. Small bumps under your back at dusk will feel
like boulders by dawn. Also check for wildlife such as snakes or insects that might already be there. This will
prevent a nasty surprise in the middle of the night.

 b. In order to preserve warmth, it is strongly suggested that you re-cover the shelter site with loose
leaves, pine needles, etc. and cover with a tarp. A good layer of leaves will act as a mattress and insulation.
Remember your body heat is being transferred to the earth while you are sleeping, not the other way around.
Insulation will keep you warm and comfortable overnight.
 c. Point the opening of the shelter away from or broadside to the wind when constructing it. This will
prevent a 'ballooning' effect when the wind gusts. It will also prevent rain from being blown into the shelter
opening and onto you.
 d. Always suspect heavy rains overnight. Ensure that your shelter is on high ground, not in a dry wash or
gully. Dig a four inch deep trench around the perimeter of your shelter with an additional runoff trench pointing
down hill. Flowing water will go into the trench and around your shelter instead of under or through it.

USE A COMPASS
## CONDITIONS
Given a compass, the magnetic azimuth and distance to a destination point. Your team has been given a point
to travel dismounted. You have been designated the compass person. Or, you spot an object in the distance and
want to know the azimuth to that point.
OJECTIVES
1. Successfully give the magnetic azimuth to a distant object +/- 5 degrees within 2 minutes.
2. Successfully move at least 600 meter's distance along the azimuths given with enough accuracy to find
coffee-can sized targets suspended at eye level within 45 minutes.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. There are two techniques to holding and determining an azimuth with a compass: the Centerhold Technique
and the Compass-to-Cheek Technique.
 a. The Centerhold Technique can be used with lensatic or orienteering compasses.
 1) If you have a lensatic compass, open it up to its fullest so the cover forms a straightedge with
the base. Then move the lens (rear sight) to the rearmost position to allow the compass dial to float freely.
 2) Hold the compass at waist level, with your elbows firmly against your sides, with your hands
in the position shown below:
The centerhold technique used with a lensatic compass. You can hold an orienteering (Silva compass) the same way.
O-0201 31-JAN-01
 3) To use a lensatic compass while holding it this way, simply look down and read the number
under the black reference line. This is the azimuth of the direction you index fingers are pointing.
 4) To use an orienteering compass while holding it this way, rotate the compass dial until the
“N” is under the needle while pointing at the target with your index fingers. Then read the dial number aligned
with the “read bearing here” line. This is the azimuth of the direction you index fingers are pointing.
 b. The Compass-to-Cheek Technique is typically used with a lensatic compass, though some newer
orienteering compasses have sighting lenses and reference lines as well.
 1) Hold the compass as shown below.
 2) To use the compass when holding it this way, look through the rear sight notch and align the
front sighting wire with your target. Look down through the lens one rear sight and read the number under the
black reference line. This is the azimuth of the direction you are sighting.
 3) This technique can be more accurate, but takes longer. If you are wearing metal glasses, they
may affect the compass when held this close to your face.
2. Following an azimuth with a compass (Daylight).
 a. With a lensatic compass:
 1) Use the centerhold technique.
 2) Rotate your body until the desired azimuth fall under the fixed black index line.
 3) Turn the bezel ring until the luminous line is aligned with the north-seeking arrow. One you
obtain alignment, the compass is preset. 
O-0201 31-JAN-01
 4) To follow an azimuth, keep the north seeking arrow aligned with the luminous line. Look
along the way your fingers are pointing, and pick out a distinctive terrain feature along the azimuth and walk
toward it. Occasionally recheck the compass to ensure the north seeking arrow is still aligned with the
luminous line.
 b. With an orienteering compass.
 1) Turn the compass dial until the desired azimuth is aligned with the “Read Bearing Here” line.
 2) Use the centerhold technique.
 3) Rotate your body until north seeking arrow is aligned with the “N” on the compass dial.
 4) To follow an azimuth, keep the north seeking arrow aligned with the “N” on the compass
dial. Look along the way your fingers are pointing, and pick out a distinctive terrain feature along the azimuth
and walk toward it. Occasionally recheck the compass to ensure the north seeking arrow is still aligned with the
“N” on the compass dial.
3. Following an azimuth with a lensatic or orienteering compass at night is the same as daytime, except you
cannot normally use terrain features for reference as you walk. Simply:
 1) Use a flashlight to set the appropriate azimuth as listed under daylight compass work (above).
Use a red or blue lens to avoid night blindness.
 2) To follow an azimuth:
 a) Orienteering Compass: To follow an azimuth, keep the north seeking arrow aligned
with the “N” on the compass dial. This only works if the arrow and the “N” are luminous.
 c) Lensatic Compass: To follow an azimuth, keep the north seeking arrow aligned with
the luminous line.
 3) Occasionally “recharge” the luminous marks by cupping your hand around a white light
flashlight and the compass dial, ensuring the compass gets the light without blinding any team members.
4. At all times avoid metal objects and electrical sources. These can affect compass accuracy. The following
safe operating distances are suggested:
 a. High Tension Power Lines -- 55 meters.
 b. Vehicles -- 10 meters
 c. Telephone poles or metal fences -- 10 meters.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup:
1. Before the student arrives. Choose a wooded area where a course can be established that is at least 600
meters long. Choose a start and a finish point and turning points along the course as necessary, and determine
the magnetic azimuth and distance between them. Hang a brightly covered coffee-can or similar object at eye
level at the destination point and other turn points on the course. Mark the can with a large letter or number.
Hang at least three other cans with different numbers at least 100 meters away from the actual destination point.
Choosing a distant terrain feature that is visible from the start point as the destination target is suggested, but if
necessary the evaluator may select a different terrain feature for personnel to demonstrate how to properly
determine an azimuth.
2. Be sure that the individual has a compass, piece of paper, and pencil.
Brief Student: Give the individual a compass and point out a distant object. Ask him to determine the magnetic
azimuth to that point. Then give him the azimuth and distance to the target can. Tell him to move to that point,
and then return and tell you the number or letter written on the target.

MEASURE DISTANCE WITH PACE COUNT
## CONDITIONS
Your team has been given a point to travel dismounted. You have been designated the pace person. You must
ensure that the team travels the required distance and does not overshoot.
OJECTIVES
Successfully move the specified number of meters up along the route using your pace count +/- 50 meters.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. A pace is equal to one natural step, about 30 inches long for an average adult male. In order to measure
distance, you must know your pace count, which is the number of paces it takes you to cover 100 meters. You
do this by measuring your pace over a pre-measured course.
 a. The terrain of the course should be similar to the terrain you will be walking over on the mission.
You will cover a lot more distance on a paved road than you will across rough terrain.
 b. The course should be between 100 and 600 meters long, in even multiples of 100. (If the course is
600 meters long, divide your total paces by 6 to determine your 100 meter pacecount. If the course is 300
meters long, divide by 3, etc.)
2. To use your pace count:
 a. Determine how far you have to travel in meters
 b. Calculate how many paces this is.
 1) For every hundred meters you must travel, add your pace count.

 2) For the last fraction of a hundred meters, use a equal fraction of your pace count.
 3) EXAMPLE: If your pacecount was 110 and the distance you had to travel was 325 meters:
 110 paces (100 meters)
 110 paces (100 meters)
 110 paces (100 meters)
 + 28 paces (25 meters is 1/4 of 100 meters, so 1/4 of your pacecount is about 28)

 358 paces (325 meters)
c. Adjust this pace count for the following factors (a shorter pace means more paces in 100 meters). 
O-0202 31-JAN-01
 1) Slopes. Your pace will lengthen on a downslope and shorten on an upgrade. Keeping this in
mind, if it normally takes you 120 paces to walk 100 meters, your pace count may increase to 130 or more when
walking up a slope.
 2) Winds. A head wind shortens the pace and a tail wind increases it.
 3) Surfaces. Sand, gravel, mud, snow, and similar surface materials tend to shorten the pace.
 4) Elements. Snow, rain, or ice cause the pace to reduced in length.
 5) Clothing. Excess clothing and boots with poor traction affect the pace length.
 6) Visibility. Poor visibility, such as fog, rain, or darkness, will shorten the pace.
 d. Begin walking, and keep track of the distance you travel. Do not try to remember the count in your
head; use a technique like one of the following:
 1) Put a pebble in your pocket every time you have walked 100 meters according to your pace
count.
 2) Tie knots in a string.
 3) Put marks in a notebook.
 4) Pace counter string.

NAVIGATE PAST AN OBSTACLE
## CONDITIONS
Given a compass. You are moving on foot following an azimuth and pace count. You encounter an obstacle
that you must go around, while continuing to keep track of your azimuth and pace count.
## OBJECTIVE
The team member "boxes" his steps around the obstacle, returns to the same azimuth, and continues to the
destination point.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Spot the obstacle and halt.
2. Record pace count up to this point (hereafter called your traveling pace count)
3. Determine if it is easier to go right or left around the obstacle.
4. If you decide to go right (if you go left, switch all references to left and right):
 a. Using the compass, turn 90 degrees to the right
 b. Walk in that direction, starting a new pace count from zero (called the lateral pace count). Continue
walking until you have moved far enough right to get around the obstacle.
 c. Halt and record how far you've walked in this direction.
 d. Turn left back to your original azimuth (the one you were on when you ran into the obstacle).
 e. Look up the pace count you were at when you spotted the obstacle and halted (your traveling pace
count).
 f. Start walking along your original azimuth, adding your steps to your traveling pace count pace count.
 g. When you are clear of the obstacle on your left, halt and record your total traveling pace count.
 h. Using the compass, turn left 90 degrees. Look up your lateral pace count (the number of steps you
moved to the right of the obstacle).
 i. Walk in this direction, starting a new pace count from zero. When you have walked the same
distance as your recorded lateral pace count, halt. You should now be on the direct opposite side of the obstacle
from where you started.
 j. Turn right back to your original azimuth.

LOCATE A POINT ON A MAP USING LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE
## CONDITIONS
Given an aeronautical chart, road map, or topographical map with latitude and longitude lines. You are away
from mission base, mounted or dismounted, and must locate your location on map in order to report your
location to mission base, an aircraft or another ground element using latitude and longitude. Or, you are
coordinating with another search element (ground or air) who has told you his location using the latitude and
longitude. You want to plot this point on your map.
## OBJECTIVES
Within 1 minute, the team member announces the correct latitude and longitude of the marked point (using the
smallest gradiations of latitude and longitude printed on the map), using correct terminology, and, within 1
minute, can plot a point on the map given the latitude and longitude orally.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Latitude and longitude are the ## OBJECTIVE position measurements used on aeronautical charts. Many road
maps and topographical maps also are gridded using this system.
 a. Lines of longitude run north-south on the map. Lines of latitude run east-west.
 b. Both latitude and longitude are measured in degrees, minutes and seconds. One minute is 1/60th of a
degree, and one second is 1/60th of a minute. In the continental US, latitude numbers are read from south to
north (bottom to top), and longitude numbers are read from east to west (right to left)
 c. Each line of latitude is labeled as either North (if it is above the equator) or South (if it is below the
equator). Each line of longitude is labeled as East (if it is east of a longitude line called the Prime Meridian) or
West (if it is west of the Prime Meridian)
 d. To read a lat-long coordinates the symbol “ ° “ means degrees, an apostrophe ( “ ‘ “) means minutes,
and a double apostrophe (“ “ “) means seconds. Always read the latitude before the longitude.
 e. Example: 32° 33’ 44” N, 45° 12’ 52” E means “32 degrees, 33 minutes, and 44 seconds North
Latitude, 45 degrees 12 minutes and 52 seconds East Longitude”
 f. On larger scale maps, or when pinpoint accuracy is not required, seconds are not used. For example,
45° 12’ N, 22° 36 W is read as “45 degrees, 12 minutes North Latitude, 22 degrees 36 minutes West
Longitude.”
2. To find the lat-long designation of a known point on the map
 a. Find the latitude:
 1) Find the numbers of the latitude degree lines to the immediate north and south of the point.
Write down the lower of the two. (For example, if the point is between 45° and 46° North latitude, write down 
O-0204 17-MAR-04
“45°“. Also write down if that latitude line is labeled as “North” or “South” (above the equator it will always be
“North”).
 2) From latitude line chosen above, count up the number of minutes that the point is from the
line using the tick marks on the edge of the map (or in the grids if the map is gridded) until you reach the last
minute marking before your point. Write down the number of minutes.
 3) From the last minute mark, count up the number of seconds to your point (if the map is of a
large scale, such as an aviation chart, it will not have marks for seconds. Either stop with the minute
measurement, or estimate seconds). Write down the number of seconds.
 b. Find the longitude.
 1) Find the numbers of the longitude degree lines to the immediate east and west of the point.
Write down the lower of the two. (For example, if the point is between 22° and 23° West latitude, write down “
22° “). Also write down if that latitude line is labeled as “East” or “West” (in the western hemisphere it will
always be “West”).
 2) From longitude line chosen above, count left the number of minutes that the point is from the
line using the tick marks on the edge of the map (or in the grids if the map is gridded) until you reach the last
minute marking before your point. Write down the number of minutes.
 3) From the last minute mark, count left the number of seconds to your point (if the map is of a
large scale, such as an aviation chart, it will not have marks for seconds. Either stop with the minute
measurement, or estimate seconds). Write down the number of seconds.
 c. NOTE: If the map is not marked with minutes or seconds, you will have to estimate. Remember,
there are 60 minutes in a degree and 60 seconds in a minute. So, if the point is halfway between two degrees, it
is at the 30 minute point. If it is one quarter the distance from one degree to another, it is at the 15 minute point.
Use the same logic to determine seconds if the map is only gradiated in degrees and minutes.
 c. Make sure the lat-long coordinate you have written down is in the format Degrees°, Minutes’,
Seconds” (North or South) Latitude, Degrees°, Minutes’, Seconds” (East or West) Longitude,
3. To plot a point given the lat-long coordinate:
 a. Find the correct latitude line and count up the correct number of minutes and seconds (below the
equator you would count down, not up).
 b. Find the correct longitude line and count left the correct number of minutes and seconds (in the
eastern hemisphere you would count right, not left).
 c. Mark the point.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Mark a point on a map or chart gridded with latitude and longitude, and give the map to the student. .
Tell him whether or not she must report seconds, or just degrees and minutes (depends on the scale of the map).
Pick a different grid location from the point and write down the latitude and longitude coordinates. Ensure you
have a timer. Because this task is timed, it is necessary to make sure that the student and work area is prepared
for testing. The map should be open and complete. If copies of maps are used, they should include all
references normally available on the full map to take the exam.
Brief Student: Ask the student if s/he is prepared. Tell the student to tell you the latitude and longitude of the
point. Then orally give him the latitude and longitude you wrote down and tell him to show you where that
point is on the map.

LOCATE A POINT ON A MAP USING THE CAP GRID SYSTEM
## CONDITIONS
Given an aeronautical chart, road map, or topographical map gridded with the CAP grid system. You are away
from mission base, mounted or dismounted, and must plot your location on a CAP gridded map in order to
report it, an aircraft or another ground element. Or, you are coordinating with another search element (ground
or air) who has told you his location using the CAP grid system. You want to plot this point on your map.
## OBJECTIVES
Within 1 minute, the team member announces the CAP grid and sub-grid that the point is located in, using
correct terminology, and can plot a point on the map given the CAP grid coordinates orally.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. The CAP grid system is designed for use on aeronautical charts, but can be adapted to any map with
latitude/longitude markings around the edge.
2. A grid is a 15 minute latitude by 15 minute longitude box. This is done by dividing the 30 minute by 30
minute boxes already on the aeronautical chart into fourths. Each grid is identified with a number. (For
example “I am located in Grid 54”).
3. To locate a position more precisely, mentally divide each grid into four quadrants. The Northwest quadrant
is “A”, the Northeast is “B”, the Southwest is “C”, and the Southeast is “D”. Say the quadrant letter after the
grid number (for example, “I am in grid 54 B”).

IDENTIFY TOPOGRAPHIC SYMBOLS ON A MAP
## CONDITIONS
Given a ## OBJECTIVE topographical map
## OBJECTIVE
Correctly identify the topographical symbols, colors, and marginal information on a map.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. In order to navigate using a map, the ground team member must know how terrain features are depicted on a
map.
2. Ideally, every feature on the Earth's surface can be shown on a map in its true shape and size. Unfortunately
this is impossible due to the limitations on detail that can be legibly transferred to paper. The amount of detail
that can be shown on a map varies as the scale of a map. Small scale map such as 1:24,000 USGS quadrangles
will show considerably more detail then 1:500,000 aeronautical sectionals.

3. Symbols are used on topographical maps to show features and details. On most topographic map the
following colors are used to classify these symbols.

 a. Black -- manmade or cultural features such as buildings, roads, railroads, names and boundaries.
 b. Blue is used for water or hydrographic features such as lakes, rivers, canals and swamps.
 c. Brown -- used for relief or contour and to show relief features such as cuts, fills, sand dunes, and
glaciers.

 d. Green -- is used for woodland cover and vegetation such as scrub, vineyards, forests, etc.
 e. Red -- emphasizes important roads and highways.
 f. Purple -- used to show revisions from previous map editions.
4. The shape and size of an object on the map will indicate it's actual shape and size on the ground. A black
solid square is a building and an irregular blue item is a lake or pond. Interpreting symbols is a matter of
knowing what color it is and how that relates to the above list, and matching the symbol to the map's legend.
The map's legend is table of symbols and what they represent. It is usually located on the bottom of the map
sheet in the marginal information or it is published separately for the ## OBJECTIVE types of topographic maps in
use.
5. The marginal information on a map shows the mapsheets relationship to the rest of the Earth. Marginal
information includes:
 a. The geographic location of the map. 
O-0210 31-JAN-01
 b. The name of the mapsheet and adjoining mapsheets.
 c. Agency preparing the map and date of printing.
 d. Scale of the map and bar scales for meters, yards,
and miles.
 e. Contour interval of contour lines.
 f. Grid to magnetic north declination diagram, or simply the magnetic variation angle.
### Additional Information

DETERMINE ELEVATION ON A MAP
## CONDITIONS
Given a ## OBJECTIVE topographical map. Your team is has been ordered to move dismounted to a destination.
Before beginning movement, you want to get an idea for the “ups and downs” of the terrain you will be
traveling over. Or, your team is having problems contacting mission base, and you wish to find a high point to
transmit form.
## OBJECTIVE
Correctly identify the elevation of any point on the map +/- 1/2 the contour interval.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Topographical maps depict the elevation of the ground through the use of contour lines. A contour line
represents an imaginary line on the ground, above or below sea level connecting points of equal elevation.
Contour lines are normally brown. There a three types of contour lines:
 a. Index Contour Lines are heavier than other lines, and are labeled with a number. This number is the
elevation of that line, in feet, yards or meters. The top of the elevation number always points uphill.
 b. Intermediate Contour Lines are the solid lines that fall between Index Contour Lines. These lines do
not have the elevation listed on them, but represent increments of the contour interval (see 2, below).
 c. Supplementary Contour Lines. These contour lines resemble dashes. They show sudden changes in
elevation of at least one-half the contour interval.
Index, Intermediate, and Supplementary contour lines. As indicated by the orientation of the “400," the terrain
slopes down towards the center of this area.
O-0211 31-JAN-01
2. Before you can read the contour lines, you must know the contour interval of the map. The contour interval
will be printed in the marginal information, near the map legend. The contour interval is the number of feet,
meters or yards that each intermediate contour line represents. (EXAMPLE: if the contour interval is 10
meters, then the Index Contour line marked with “100” is 100 meters above sea level, and each intermediate
line above it is 10 more meters)
3. To determine the elevation of a point on the map:
 a. Determine the contour interval of the map, and the unit of measure used (feet, meters or yards).
 b. Find the numbered index contour line nearest the point.
 c. Determine if you are going from lower elevation to higher, or vice versa. For example, if the point
was somewhere between the “500” and the “600” Index contour lines, you know the terrain gets higher as it
gets closer to the “600” line.
 d. Start at the Index contour line below the point (in the above example, the “500” line) and count the
number of Intermediate contour lines between the lower Index contour line and the point. For each intermediate
line, add the contour interval.
 e. If the point is halfway between two contour lines, add half the contour interval.
 f. If the point is a hilltop, determine the elevation of the contour line closest to the hilltop and add half
the contour interval.
EXAMPLE: If the above map has a contour interval of 20 meters, point (a) is slightly above 100 meters in
elevation, point (b) is at approximately 170 meters, and point (c) is at approximately 190 meters.
4. Depressions. Depressions (the opposite of a hilltop) are often marked with small hatchmarks on the contour
line pointing inward towards the center of the depression. To determine the depth of the depression, determine
the elevation of the innermost contour line of the depression and subtract half the contour interval. 
O-0211 31-JAN-01
Given the contour interval of 20 feet, the rim of the depression is at an elevation of 240 feet, and the center of
the depression is at 230 feet.
### Additional Information
More detailed information on this topic is available in Chapter 5 of the Ground Team Member and Leader
Reference Text.
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: On an appropriate topographical map, mark five points on the map, including one hilltop and one
depression.
Brief Team Leader: Tell the team leader to determine the elevation of all five points.

MEASURE DISTANCE ON A MAP
## CONDITIONS
Given a ## OBJECTIVE topographical or aeronautical map with bar scales, a piece of paper, pencil, and straight edge.
You are away from mission base, mounted or dismounted, and must move to another location. You have
plotted your position on the map, and the position to which you are to move. Now you want to determine the
distance you will have to move.
## OBJECTIVES
1. Determine the straight-line distance between two points with no more than five percent error, within 2
minutes.
2. Determine the road distance between two points with no more than 10 percent error, within 2 minutes.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Background information:
 a. Distance can be straight line (if you are walking cross country) or along a curved road or path.
 b. Distance for mounted travel should be determined in miles, since car odometers are gradiated in
miles. Distance for walking should be determined in meters, so you can use your pace count. There are 0.62
miles in a kilometer (1000 meters) and 1600 meters in a mile.
 c. All topographical maps are drawn to scale (1:24,000:, 1:62,500:, etc.). This means that a one
millimeter of map distance equals 24,000 millimeters (24 meters) ground distance for a ## OBJECTIVE 1:24,000
USGS quadrangle.
2. Methods of Measuring Straight-line Distance:
 a. One method of determining ground distance from a map is to use a ruler to measure the distance
between two map points and multiply that by the scale factor. However, this involves doing somewhat
complicated multiplication in the field.
 b. A simpler way is to use the bar scales located at the bottom of the map. These scales are usually
printed in meters, yards, and miles. By taking the ruler or the edge of a piece of paper and mark on it the
straight-line distance between the two map points. Then put the ruler or piece of paper under the appropriate bar
scale and read the ground distance in the appropriate units.
3. To find the road distance between two points on a map, place a tick mark on edge of the piece of paper and
then place the tick mark at the first point. Align the paper with the road edge until you come to a curve, mark
the paper and the map at the curve. Pivot the paper so that it continues to follow the road edge to the next curve.
Repeat the process until you get to the second point, where you make the final tick mark on the paper. At this
point you can take the paper to the appropriate bar scales and determine the ground distance between the first
and last tick marks. This will be the road distance between the two points on the map.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: On an appropriate topographical map, mark two points on the map as A and B (these points should be
3,000 to 4,000 meters apart in ground distance). On a road or trail on the map, mark two points C and D at least
3,000 meters apart ground distance. Give the student the map, a pencil, a strip of paper, and a ruler.
Brief Student: Tell the student to determine the straight-line distance between points A and B to within a 5
percent error and the road distance from C to D to within a 10 percent error.

CONVERT BETWEEN MAP AND COMPASS AZIMUTHS
## CONDITIONS
Given a gridded map and an aviation map, each with magnetic variation information.
## OBJECTIVES
Perform each of the following within one minute each: convert a magnetic azimuth to a grid azimuth, convert a
grid azimuth to a magnetic azimuth, convert a magnetic azimuth to a true azimuth, and convert a true azimuth to
a magnetic azimuth.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. In order work with a map and compass, you must understand the concept of Magnetic Variation (sometimes
called declination):
 a. There are 360 degrees in a circle, with 0° (which is also 360°) pointing north, 90° pointing east, 180°
pointing south, and 270° pointing west.
 b. There are actually three different “norths”: true, grid, and magnetic. You must be able to work with
all three.
 1) True North is the direction along the earth’s toward the north pole. Lines of longitude are
“true north” lines, since they converge at the north pole. Aviation charts are “True North” maps.
 2) Grid North is used by maps that are not gridded in longitude (such a military UTM maps).
Grid lines are straight and do not converge at the north pole, so grid north can be different from true north,
especially as you get near either pole.
 3) Magnetic North is direction along the earth’s surface toward the north MAGNETIC pole.
This is NOT the same as the north pole -- the north magnetic pole drifts slowly each year, and is never exactly
at the north pole. In Maryland, for example, magnetic north is 10° - 11° off of True North. This is important,
because your compass will point to magnetic north, but your map will either be drawn to true north or Grid
North.
2. Converting from map to compass headings:
 a. To convert between Magnetic North and True North on a True North Map:
 1) Find the Magnetic Variation (sometimes called declination on non-aviation maps).
 a) On an aviation chart, there will be magenta lines running generally from north to south
on the chart with degree markings on them (for example “10° W”). Choose the line halfway between the two
points you have marked on the chart. 
O-0213 31-JAN-01
 b) On other maps, look to the legend. It should note the magnetic variation, or
declination, of the map.
 2) Note the number of degrees and whether it labeled East or West
 3) To convert True (map) azimuths to Magnetic (compass) azimuths, remember the saying
“EAST IS LEAST, WEST IS BEST”.
 a) If the Magnetic Variation is East, subtract the Magnetic Variation from the True
azimuth.
 b) If the Magnetic Variation is West, add the Magnetic Variation from the True azimuth.
 4) To convert Magnetic (compass) azimuths to True (map) azimuths, do the opposite of above.
 a) If the Magnetic Variation is East, add the Magnetic Variation from the True azimuth.
 b) If the Magnetic Variation is West, subtract the Magnetic Variation from the True
azimuth.
 b. To convert between Magnetic North and Grid North on a Grid North Map:
 1) Find the Magnetic Variation (sometimes called declination on non-aviation maps or the G-M
Angle (Grid-Magnetic) on military maps. This should be in the legend, or in a small box near the legend.
 2) Note the number of degrees and whether it labeled East or West
 3) To convert Grid (map) azimuths to Magnetic (compass) azimuths:
 a) If the Magnetic Variation is East, subtract the Magnetic Variation from the True
azimuth.
 b) If the Magnetic Variation is West, add the Magnetic Variation from the True azimuth.
 4) To convert Magnetic (compass) azimuths to True (map) azimuths, do the opposite of above.
 a) If the Magnetic Variation is East, add the Magnetic Variation from the True azimuth.
 b) If the Magnetic Variation is West, subtract the Magnetic Variation from the True
azimuth.

## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. In some situations, a team might be given an azimuth to plot. A good example would be if another ground
team has determined a bearing to a distress beacon from their location. Plotting this azimuth on your map could
help with the search.
2. To plot an azimuth.
 a. Plot the point on the map.
 b. Ensure that the azimuth is a grid, not a magnetic azimuth. If it is magnetic, convert to a grid azimuth.
 c. Place the protractor on the point with the “0” degree mark oriented to grid north. Place a pencil mark
at the degree mark on protractor corresponding to the azimuth.
 d. With a straightedge, draw a line from the first point (the position) through the mark you just made.

DETERMINE AZIMUTHS ON A MAP USING TWO POINTS
## CONDITIONS
Given a protractor, pencil, straightedge, and a map. You are away from mission base, and must move to another
location. You have plotted your position on the map, and the position you are to move to. Now you want to
determine the direction to move. Or, you have shot a magnetic bearing to a landmark, and wish to plot this
bearing on a map from your position in order to verify the landmark.
## OBJECTIVES
Within 2 minutes, the team leader determines the azimuth from one point to another on the map and converts it
to the magnetic azimuth. Within 2 minutes, the team member must convert a magnetic azimuth to a grid
azimuth and plot it from a known point on a map.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. This task is essential for using a compass and map together. In order to navigate, you must be able to
convert a compass heading to a line on a map, and convert a line on a map to a compass heading. Before you
train on this task, ensure you can perform task O-0213, Convert Between Map And Compass Azimuths.
2. To determine a magnetic azimuth between two points on a map
 a. The ## OBJECTIVE (protractor) method:
 1) Plot both points on a map.
 2) Draw a line between the two points (and beyond the second point if necessary to ensure the
line is longer than the radius of the protractor).
 3) Position a protractor with the center point over the first point (your location), and ensure that
the “ 0° “ mark on the protractor points is aligned with north on the map (called grid north)
 4) Read the number off the protractor that is on the line. This is the map (either True or Grid,
depending on the map) azimuth.
 5) Convert the azimuth to a magnetic azimuth (see separate task O-0213).
 b. Alternate method for measuring azimuths without a protractor. First draw the line between the points
as described above, and then:
 1) With an orienteering (Silva) compass:
 (a) Place the compass on the map with one of the baseplate side edges on the line you
drew. 
O-0215 31-JAN-01
 (b) While keeping the baseplate still, rotate the compass dial until the “N” on the dial
points to grid (or true) north on the map.
 (c) Read the number on the compass dial that is in line with “Read Bearing Here” arrow
on the baseplate. This is your grid (or true) azimuth).
 2. With a lensatic compass (this is less accurate than using a protractor or orienteering compass):
 (a) Orient the map to magnetic north (see separate task O-0217)
 (b) Place the compass on the map so that the straightedge on the left side of the compass
on the line you drew (if your compass does not have a straightedge, use the sighting wire. This is less accurate).
 (c) Read the number on the compass dial under the fixed black index line on the glass.
This is your magnetic azimuth. If you need a true or grid azimuth, convert as needed (see separate task O0213).
4. To plot an azimuth on a map.
 a. Using a protractor:
 1) Ensure you are working with a grid azimuth. If not, convert it (see separate task O-0213).
 2) Mark the location you wish to plot the azimuth from on the map.
 3) Place the center hole of the protractor on that point, with the 0 degree mark aligned with grid
north on the map.
 4) Place a mark by the point on the protractor corresponding with the grid azimuth.
 5) With a straightedge, connect the two marks.
 b. Using an orienteering compass.
 1) Ensure you are working with a grid azimuth. If not, convert it (see separate task O-0213).
 2) Rotate the compass dial until the azimuth you want to plot is in line with the “Read Bearing
Here” line on the base plate.
 3) Mark the location you wish to plot the azimuth from on the map.
 4) Without rotating the compass dial. Place the center of the compass dial over that point, with
the 0 degree (North) mark on the compass dial, oriented with true north.
 5) Place a mark on the map at the end of the “Read Bearing Here” line.
 6) With a straightedge, connect the two marks.
 c. Using a lensatic compass (less accurate): 
O-0215 31-JAN-01
 1. Orient the map to magnetic north (see separate task O-0216)
 2. Ensure you are working with a magnetic azimuth. If not, convert it
 3) Mark the location you wish to plot the azimuth from on the map.
 4). Place one end of the straight edge on the side of the compass on the mark you made on the
map.
 5) Keeping the straight edge of the compass on the mark, rotate the compass until the index
mark lines up with the magnetic azimuth you wish to plot.
 6) Draw a line along the compass straight edge. (If your compass does not have a straightedge,
you can use the sighting wire, but this is not very accurate).

ORIENT A MAP TO THE GROUND USING TERRAIN ASSOCIATION
## CONDITIONS
Given a ## OBJECTIVE topographical map in the daylight
## OBJECTIVES
Orient the map to North to within 30 degrees within 4 minutes.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
 1. In order to use your map for navigation, you must “orient” the map to the ground. A map is considered
oriented when it is in a horizontal position with it's north and south corresponding to north and south on the
ground. This allows you to easily see the terrain on the map as it corresponds to the terrain around you.
Orienting the map can be quickly done without a compass if there are prominent terrain features nearby.
2. To orient the map:

 a. Look at the map and the ground to find two or more terrain features common to both. Examples are
hills, saddles, valleys, ridges or cultural features such as buildings or radio towers.
 b. Rotates the map until the terrain features are aligned with the map. (For example, if there is a tower
to your right and the mountain in front of you, rotate the map until the tower on the map is on the right and the
mountain on the map is towards the top). By aligning the terrain features on the map with the same terrain
features on the ground, the map is oriented.
 c. Whenever possible, use three features, to ensure you do not accidentally orient the map 180 degrees
out.

## CONDITIONS
Given a ## OBJECTIVE topographical map and a compass in the daylight
## OBJECTIVES
Orient the map to North to within 10 degrees in less than 4 minutes.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. You want to use your map for navigation. First, you must “orient” the map to the ground. A map is
considered oriented when it is in a horizontal position with its north and south corresponding to north and south
on the ground. This allows you to easily see the terrain on the map as it corresponds to the terrain around you.
Orienting the map with a compass is more accurate than using terrain association, and can be done when there
are no visible prominent terrain features.
 2. To orient the map using a compass:
 a. Hold the map horizontally or place on a flat surface (DO NOT USE THE HOOD OF A VEHICLE
OR ANY OTHER METAL SURFACE -- IT MIGHT ATTRACT THE COMPASS NEEDLE)
 b. Look at the map and define the north/south grid lines and magnetic variation (see task O-0213 -
Convert Between Map And Compass Azimuths). Determine where magnetic north is on the map
 c. Hold the compass in front of you such that the north seeking arrow is free to rotate. Rotate your body
until the arrow is pointing directly in front of your body.
 d. Rotate the map until magnetic north on the map is pointing the same direction as the compass arrow.
 e. Verify the map’s orientation by checking the location of prominent terrain features.

MOVE FROM POINT TO POINT IN A VEHICLE USING A MAP
## CONDITIONS
Given a vehicle with driver, state road map, topographical map, and compass.
## OBJECTIVES
Successfully navigate to three designated points and return to the start point within 1 hour.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Virtually every sortie begins with driving to some point. Additionally, entire hasty searches must be done
mounted (in a vehicle). Because of this, team leaders must become proficient at mounted navigation.
2. To find a point by mounted navigation
 a. On the map, determine the route you will take (see task O-0209 - Identify Topographical Symbols on
a Map)
 b. Choose checkpoints along the way. These should be easily recognizable features along your route,
such a bridges or road intersections. Every point where you will turn should be a checkpoint.
 c. Measure the distance between each checkpoint (see task O-0211 - Measure Distance on a Map) and
write it down.
 d. Move to the point:
 1) Don’t try to navigate and drive. Let someone else drive so you can concentrate on the map.
 2) Use the odometer to measure the distance between points. That way you’ll know when
checkpoints are coming up, or if you passed them by accident.
 3) Rely on terrain association whenever possible (see task O-0217 - Locate Own Position by
Terrain Association). The metal in your vehicle will make compasses unreliable.
 4) If you must use a compass. Get out of the vehicle and move at least 10 yards away from it.
This keeps the metal in the vehicle from affecting the compass (See task O-0201 - Use a Compass).
 5) Don’t speed, stop abruptly, block traffic or break any traffic laws. Make sure to park clear of
the road when stopping, and be careful when exiting the vehicle when traffic is driving by.

Setup: Pick at least three points, approximately 5 to 10 miles apart. At each point, place a marker, clearly
visible from the road, with a number on it. Choose points that are located on the topographical map, but are not
marked on the ## OBJECTIVE state road map. Provide the team leader with a vehicle and driver, a compass, a state
road map marked with all three points (their approximate locations) and a topographical map marked with all

DETERMINE DISTRESS BEACON BEARING
## CONDITIONS
You are a member of a ground team searching for an distress beacon that is at least 1/2 a mile away. You have
been given the task of operating the detection finding (DF) equipment.
OJECTIVES
Indicate the direction to the distress beacon +/- 10 degrees within 10 minutes.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. The majority of CAP search missions are electronic searches for distress beacons. Correct use of DF
equipment is critical to these searches. The first step to locating distress beacon is to determine the general
direction to the location of the distress beacon. (NOTE: This section was written using the popular L-tronics
LH-16 l-per as the DF unit. Technical procedures should be adapted by units with other equipment).
.
2. To determine the bearing to a distress beacon:
 a. Assemble the LH-16 on the antenna mast assembly and hold vertically in front of you, such that you
can see the receiver controls.
 b. Turn the unit on, turn the volume and sensitivity full up, set the MODE knob to DF. Set the
FREQUENCY KNOB to the appropriate frequency (121.775 for practice distress beacons, 121.5 and 243
(military distress beacons or harmonic transmitted by basic distress beacons) for actual distress beacons, many
military aircraft carry civilian distress beacons; civilian distress beacons by law transmit on both frequencies.).
Listen for the distress beacon signal. If you have no signal, move to some other location where you do.
 c. Once you have the signal, swing the antenna slowly through a full circle around you and determine
where the needle centers. If it centers more than twice, analyze your location to determine if you might be
dealing with more than one signal, reflections or interference from power lines, etc. Remember all directions
where the needle centers.
 d. Switch to the REC mode and determine where the signal strength is greatest (needle deflected farthest
to the right, signal direction is off the left antenna mast). The strongest signal direction should be in one of the
same directions that the needle centered in the DF mode.
 e. Switch back to the DF mode and locate where the needle centers in the direction where the REC mode
receives a maximum signal. While one person keeps the unit aligned on the signal, another stands behind him
and takes a compass bearing (see task O-0201 - Use a Compass.)
 f. As you get closer to the signal, decrease the sensitivity to avoid overloading the receiver.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Set up a practice beacon transmitting on 121.775 MHz at least one half mile away from the test site.
Take a set of DF equipment, and ensure that one can get a good strong signal to the practice beacon (verify the
direction off a map). With a compass, determine the magnetic bearing to the practice beacon. Disassemble the
DF equipment and give it to the student.
Brief Student: Tell the student to assemble the DF gear, determine the direction to the practice beacon, and
point it out to you. When he points, check the bearing with a compass.

LOCATE A DISTRESS BEACON
## CONDITIONS
You are a member of a ground team searching for a distress beacon (ELT/EPIRB). You have been given the
task of operating the detection finding (DF) equipment. You have used the direction finding (DF) technique to
close in on the signal, and now you know the distress beacon is nearby.
OJECTIVES
Within 30 minutes, use signal strength techniques to locate a practice beacon located within 200 meters of your
location. (This is for a wooded area. More time should be allotted for an urban or airport environment).
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Once the team has moved close to the distress beacon using the DF technique, that technique may become
less effective. You know you are close when the signal is loud even with the sensitivity turned down. At this
point signal strength techniques may be used easily. There are two techniques - normal signal strength and
body blocking. These techniques can be used with DF equipment, or any portable radio or scanner that can pick
up the distress beacon frequency (121.775 for practice, 121.5 and 243 for civilian and military distress beacons
respectively).
2. To locate the distress beacon:
 a. Assemble the DF gear or radio and tune to the appropriate frequency. Use a short antenna (such as a
“rubber duck” flexible antenna). Ensure you can hear the signal of the distress beacon. Adjust the sensitivity
and volume so that you can barely hear the signal.
 b. Body Blocking. To determine a bearing to the distress beacon, place the receiver at waist level and
rotate in a circle until weakest signal is heard. At this point the target distress beacon should be directly behind
you, since your body is blocking the signal from the distress beacon.
 c. Signal Strength. If you are sure the distress beacon is located nearby (for example, if you are at an
airfield and you are sure it is in one of the planes) simple walk through the area.. As the signal strength
increases rapidly, you are getting closer to the distress beacon. Decrease the sensitivity (or increase squelch),
reduce the antenna height or slightly offset the receiver frequency as you get closer to permit body-blocking.

O-0302 31-JAN-01
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Hide a practice beacon transmitting on the practice frequency approximately 200 meters from the test
site. Take a set of DF equipment, and ensure that one can get a good strong signal to the practice beacon.
Disassemble the DF equipment and give it to the student. The evaluator should be prepared to document the
time it takes each student to locate the practice beacon. If multiple students have difficulty locating the practice
beacon within the time allotted, the evaluator may need to re-evaluate students or the time allotted based on
location.
Brief Student: Tell the student to locate the practice beacon within 30 minutes (add more time if the practice
beacon is in an urban or airport environment).
Evaluation

DEACTIVATE A DISTRESS BEACON
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a ground team that has found a distress beacon. Either there were no victims, or the victims
have been taken care of, and the site is considered safe.
## OBJECTIVES
Take the proper steps to deactivate the distress beacon.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. It is essential to turn off any distress beacon (ELTs, EPIRBs, PLBs, or other transmitters. A transmitting
distress beacon can mask other distress signals. The vast majority of distress beacon finds are non-distress
situations, where an distress beacon has gone off accidentally. In a distress situation, the primary responsibility
is to help any victims. Additionally, no one should put themselves in danger to deactivate an distress beacon.
2. Once the distress beacon has been found the following procedures should be followed (only a, c, e and f
apply in distress situations):
 a. Immediately report the find to mission base.
 b. Attempt to locate the aircraft/boat owner in order to gain access to the distress beacon.
 c. If the owner is unavailable, contact the FBO or harbor master and local law enforcement officials to
permit access to the aircraft or boat.
 d. Locate and deactivate the distress beacon, monitoring 121.5 Mhz to insure the signal ceases. If
possible disconnect the battery. Distress Beacons are normally located in the tail section of small planes. Large
commercial planes sometimes have a small access door on the fuselage to access an on/off switch to the distress
beacon. ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE SIGNAL HAS STOPPED - YOU MIGHT HAVE THE WRONG
DISTRESS BEACON.
 e. Leave a distress beacon deactivation sticker, so that the owner knows that his distress beacon has been
deactivated if not present when silenced. If you don’t have a sticker, leave a note where the pilot will find it.
 f. Immediately inform the incident commander and pass on the following information:
 1) Manufacturer, make, model and serial # of the distress beacon.
 2). Battery type and expiration date.
 3) Time of deactivation.
 4) Aircraft or boat ID # (if appropriate)
 5) Any other pertinent information.
 g. If the distress beacon cannot be deactivated, disconnect the antenna or construct an 'antenna tent' with
aluminum foil so that the signal will no longer interfere with SARSAT. While this process is going on, the team
leader should contact the incident commander to keep him informed and to receive further instructions.

airport. Ask the team member what steps he or she would take to deactivate it. When the team member states
that he/she would try to find the owner, ask the team member what he/she would do if the owner is not
available. After this, give the team member the distress beacon and ask him to demonstrate what he/she would
do. Finally, ask what the team member would do if the distress beacon could not be deactivated.

 TRIANGULATE ON A DISTRESS BEACON SIGNAL
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a ground or urban direction finding team assigned to locate a distress beacon that is 4 kilometers
away. Your team has a direction finder, and has taken magnetic azimuths to the distress beacon from two
points that are at least 45 degrees apart. You have a map, protractor, straightedge and a pencil.
## OBJECTIVE
Utilizing the azimuths recorded, within 10 minutes, plot the location of the distress beacon within 500 meters by
triangulation on a topographic map or aeronautical chart.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. When involved in a distress beacon search, the ground or urban direction finding team will probably be
given a fairly large area to cover. Through the use of triangulation, the team leader can quickly narrow the
search area.
2. In order to locate a distress beacon by triangulation:
 a. Conduct a map study to determine where to take reading from. Specifically look for:
 1) High terrain features. these are normally places where you are most likely to receive the
signal.
 2) Travel routes.- to determine how to traverse the area.
 3) Presence of major power lines and buildings, which can block the distress beacon signal.
These are bad places to take a reading.
 b. Obtaining readings from at least two locations. Two methods can be used to determine where to take
readings.
 1) Connect the DF unit to an external 1/4 wave-2 meter antenna mounted on the team vehicle.
Drive around the search area in a set pattern until the signal is heard, at which point direction finding can be
accomplished using the mast antenna assembly.
 2) Drive to high, clear locations and attempt to take readings using the mast antenna assembly.
If no signal is heard, proceed to the next location.
 c. At each site where a reading can be taken.
 1) Plot the point on the map where you took the reading.
 2) Determine the azimuth to the distress beacon (see task O-0301: Determine Distress Beacon
Bearing). 
O-0304 17-MAR-04
 3) Plot the azimuth on the map, making sure to convert from magnetic to grid azimuth (see task
Determine and Plot Azimuths on a Map).
 4) Remember to report each reading to mission base. Include your location, the bearing to the
distress beacon, and the signal strength.
 d. TRIANGULATION: Extend the line you drew for each azimuth until they cross. The distress
beacon should be located at or near the intersection of the lines (this technique is most accurate when the lines
intersect at a 90 degree angle. The more parallel the lines, the less accurate the plot). Take additional readings
and draw more lines to increase the accuracy of the plot.
### Additional Information
More detailed information on this topic is available in Chapters 5 and 6 of the Ground Team Member and
Leader Reference Text.
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: On a map, determine a distress beacon location. Determine two points where DF readings could be
taken and mark them on a map. Make sure to choose two points which will result in azimuths to the practice
beacon that will intersect at no less than a 45 degree angle and are about 4 kilometers from the practice beacon.
Determine the azimuth from both points to the practice beacon location, but don’t mark these, or the practice
beacon location on the map. Convert the azimuths to magnetic azimuths. On a sheet of paper, write down the
practice beacon location and the magnetic azimuths from each point. Provide the individual to be tested with
the map, a pencil, a protractor, and a straight edge.
Brief Team Leader: Tell the team leader that he is leading a team on a practice beacon search. Ask the team
leader to describe two methods of finding a points to take DF readings from. Then tell the team leader that his
team has taken readings from the two marked points. Give the team leader the magnetic azimuth from each
point, and tell him or her to locate the practice beacon by triangulation within 10 minutes.

WORK WITH CANINE SEARCH TEAMS
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a ground team that has been assigned to work with a canine search team on a sortie.
OJECTIVES
Position and conduct yourself to remain safe and avoid interfering with the dog team’s work. You may provide
radio communications support for the canine handler.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. CAP will often work with canine search teams, including those of the police and volunteer agencies. Dogs
are especially useful in missing persons searches. CAP ground teams must know how to work with the dog
team without interfering with the dog’s search abilities.
2. Search dogs fall into three categories: tracking, trailing and air-scenting.
 a. There are specialized air-scent dogs for underwater, avalanche, cadaver, drug, and weapons searches.
The rules for working with any specialized dog teams are the same. Air-scent dogs are deployed downwind of
the search area and are trained to detect human scents traveling on the wind. These dogs may also work at
times in the tracking or trailing mode. These dogs are usually the preferred resource.
 b. Tracking dogs are trained to follow a specific scent and are not necessarily affected by other humans.
An article of the missing person's clothing is held under the dogs nose until he 'gets the scent'. The dog is then
capable of tracking that scent on the ground through the woods to the missing person. They can be confused
by “additional scents “ that mask the target scent. These dogs may also be confused by a broken track. For this
reason that this type of dog is deployed early in the missing person search, i.e. before the target scent fades or
the search area is filled with other search resources.
 c. Trailing dogs are similar to tracking canines, but pick up scent that originates in a addition to the
original track. A person brushes against items and leaves a trail of dead skin cells and other items fallen off
from the body.
3. Search dogs and their handlers are highly trained search resources. The dogs are not always considered
friendly or as pets.
4. Search dog teams have a approximate 50% to 80% probability of detection (POD) on any given sortie for a
well trained dog. Good handlers will have a more accurate estimate of their team's POD.

5, The five rules for working with dog teams are:
 a. Coordinate your team’s actions with the dog handler.
 b. Clear the upwind search area of any personnel and stay downwind of the dog and handler at all times.
(especially important when working with air-scent dogs) 
O-0401 31-JAN-01
 c. When searching or traveling with an air-scent team, keep a good distance behind the dog and handler
(as defined by the handler) and allow them to work unimpeded.
 d. When in doubt, follow the instructions of the dog handler.
 e. Unless the handler specifically allows it, keep all personnel away from the search dogs in the field
and at base camp. DO NOT ALLOW ANYBODY TO FEED OR PLAY WITH THE DOGS. KEEP ALL
MOTOR VEHICLES AWAY FROM THE DOGS AS THE EXHAUST DEADENS THE SCENT AND
SENSE OF SMELL. DO NOT SMOKE AROUND DOGS.
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: None
Brief Student: Tell the student to describe the deployment and uses of an air-scent dog, tracking dog and
trailing dog, and then list four rules for working with dog teams.

EMPLOY SCANNING TECHNIQUES WHILE ON FOOT
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a ground team on a search mission in the field.
OJECTIVES
Employ appropriate scanning techniques and identify clues while moving across the terrain.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Searching systematically is the mission of the ground search and rescue team. Individual team members
accomplish this by scanning their assigned search sector systematically to ensure that the entire area is covered.
Night scanning is similar to day scanning, but relies more on peripheral vision, which is more effective than
direct vision in limited visibility ## CONDITIONS.
2. The following rules apply to individuals moving as part of a search line or team:

 a. Scan the entire area in front of you from left to right and then from right to left.
 b. Observe areas blocked by foliage or terrain that should be investigated closely.
 c. Look down at the ground close at hand and up in the tree branches for clues.
 d. As you move through the woods investigate the areas that were blocked by foliage on your initial
scan.
 e. Remember that clue-consciousness is critical. Look for the clues that will lead you to the target, not
just the target itself.
 f. Occasionally stop for a moment and listen for clues.

 g. Turn around and observe the area behind you for clues that could have been missed as you passed
through.
 h. Individual searchers do not need to maintain an absolutely straight line when moving through the
woods. Move around as required to investigate and search the entire area. Ensure that you know and do
maintain the teams base direction of movement.
3. At night, the following additional rules apply:
 a. Do not stare at any one spot too long.
 b. Do not use white light (unless conducting a full light search). White light will destroy your night
vision. 
O-0403 31-JAN-01
 c. Avoid white light for 30 minutes prior to the search to give your eyes time to adjust. If you are
moving to the search site by car, turn off the overhead dome light.
d. Be especially alert for movement or noise.

MOVE AS PART OF A SEARCH LINE
## CONDITIONS
You are a member of a ground team moving through the woods on a line search.
OJECTIVES
Maintain the specified interval, direction, and speed, expanding and contracting on the base man as needed,
while remaining alert for both the search target and commands from the team leader.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. When moving in a line search it is extremely important to maintain the proper interval, direction and speed.
As a team member, you must maintain this direction and your interval while moving through varying terrain in
order to ensure an efficient search.
 a. The interval between members is specified by the team leader to insure a certain level of coverage.
Team interval is defined as the number of team members to your left and right you must keep in sight. For a
very spread out search, the team leader will specify that you only need to see one person on your left and right.
For a very concentrated search, you might be told to keep two or three people on each side within your sight.
 b. The search line also has a direction of movement. This is determined by guiding on something such
as a compass azimuth, a terrain feature like a road, or a marked line left by the team’s last sweep through the
area. One team member will normally be designated as the base team member. He or she is responsible for
maintaining direction. This will normally be the person at one end of the search line, following a terrain feature
or marked route. It could be someone in the middle, though, if the team is following an azimuth or a terrain
feature in the middle of the search line. In very spread out searches (with an interval of one person on either
side in sight), it is probable that all members of the team might be given the compass azimuth to follow.
 c. Search lines move as fast as the slowest searcher. Some parts of the search area might be harder to
search or more difficult to travel through. The team should always slow down for the slowest searcher, not
make that person speed up and possibly miss a clue.
 d. Search lines do not have to be silent. Feel free to talk to the team members on your left and right in
order to maintain proper interval, direction and speed. Don't confuse this for idle chit-chat being acceptable.
Remember to stay focused on your job.
2. To move as part of a search line:
 a. Know the appropriate interval, direction and location of the base team member (to your left or right).
 b. As you move, space yourself so you can barely see the number of team members on either side
specified by the interval.
 c. If the terrain changes and you cannot see the required number of team members, move towards the
base. If you cannot see the persons farther away from the base than you, then advise them to move in as well. 
O-0404 31-JAN-01
 d. Maintain proper direction either with your own compass (if specified) or by observing the team
members closer to the base member than you.
 e. You do not have to keep an absolutely straight line as you walk. You can move about in order to
effectively search all the terrain, as long as you maintain the appropriate general direction.
 f. Try to stay on-line with other members. If they stop, you stop.
 g. Do not rush to catch up. If it is taking longer to search the area you are in, have the other team
members slow down.
 h. Any team member may halt the line for safety or possible clue/find, but only the leader can forward the line.
### Additional Information
More detailed information on this topic is available in Chapter 7 of the Ground Team Member & Leader
Reference Text.
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Place the individual on a search line of at least five people. Choose an area of restricted visibility
terrain, such as woods, to move through.

COMMUNICATE TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SEARCH LINE
## CONDITIONS
You are a part of a team conducting a line search, and the team leader issues a verbal command to the team or a
team member calls for the team leader.

OJECTIVES
Quickly relay all verbal commands and reports to team members farther from the speaker.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. The primary means of communication within a search line is verbal. Since a team is spread out to cover a
large search area, not everyone can hear everyone else. To solve this problem, team members relay leader
commands and member reports to other members of the team who are further away from the speaker or whistle
signals are utilized in accordance with task O-0406.
2. To relay a command or a report.
 a. Immediately obey the command. (If you hear “HALT THE LINE," then halt immediately before
relaying the command.)
 b. Determine from which direction the command came.
 c. Repeat the message exactly, shouting it in the direction of team members farther from the speaker
than yourself. If you are sure that there is no one farther from the speaker than you, you need not repeat the
message.
 d. Example: You hear “FORWARD THE LINE” from someone on your left. Start moving. Then turn
to the team members on your right, and shout “FORWARD THE LINE."
3. To send a verbal message:
 a. Shout your message toward where you believe the team leader is.
 b. Listen to ensure that the team members on either side of you have relayed your message
appropriately. If no response is heard, repeat your message until the team members at your side do respond.

USE WHISTLE SIGNALS
## CONDITIONS
You are part of a team in the field, and wish to communicate using a whistle.
OJECTIVES
Demonstrate the four whistle signals correctly.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Whistle signals are used to transmit commands along the search line or whenever team members are
separated too far for voice communications.
2. Normally, team members do not repeat whistle signals that they here. This can cause confusion. However,
if you believe the signal can't be heard by some members of the team, repeat the signal you hear.
3. The whistle signals are:
 a. 1 short blast -- Forward the line (team moves forward)
 b. 2 short blasts -- Stop the line (team stops). If you are moving and hear only one blast, stop anyway.
 c. 3 short blasts -- Help or danger signal (Stop immediately)
 d. 1 long blast -- Assemble on the signal origin (the person blowing the whistle)

1. If the target of a search is conscious, it is advantageous to let the target know you are in the area. That way,
even if you don’t spot him, he may signal you. This is done by conducting attraction tasks - basically being
visible and easily heard. Stealth is not a good thing on a search line. However, you still need moments of
silence when you listen for the target’s response. By day, noise is the primary attraction. At night, noise and
light are effective.
2. Sound Attraction Techniques (usable day or night).

 a. Shouting out the target’s name (make sure it has been released by the Public Affairs Officer first.)
 b. Honking vehicle horns during route searches.
 c. Use of public address systems.
 d. The “Sound Sweep:
 1) On command from the team leader, the team halts and all members blow their whistles for 15
seconds.
 2) After blowing the whistle, the team remains stationary and silent for one minute listening for
a response.
3. Light Attraction Techniques (usable at night):
 a. Building a bonfire (when stationary for long periods).
 b. Hanging light sticks in the trees (when stationary). Be sure to collect them when you leave.
 c. Shining Flashlights. Avoid blinding team members. IF you are searching without lights, use a red or
blue lens for an attraction light (to avoid night blindness).
 d. Car headlights during vehicle searches.
 e. Hanging signs that direct the lost person towards your camp or base.

MARK A ROUTE
## CONDITIONS
Given a roll of surveyor’s tape or other marking paper or tape and daylight. You are the end person on a search
line, or the designated marker while moving in column. Your team leader has told you to mark your route
through the woods.
OJECTIVES
Mark a route of travel so that you can you can back track on it.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1.. Route marking is very important when searching. If a team marks the edges of the area it searches, it can
ensure it does not miss or “double cover” any terrain. Marking can also be important in other situations, such as
marking the route to an isolated crash site in order to assist emergency workers in getting to the site.
2. Normally a team marks both the left and right side of the area it searches unless:
 a. One side of the search area is a clearly definable linear terrain feature, such as a road, stream, or edge
of a forest.
 b. One side is already marked from the teams previous pass through the area.
3. To mark a route:
 a. Determine what color of marking tape to use. It is best to use a different color for each end of the
line. Also, to avoid confusion, ensure the area does not already contain old markings in the same color.
 b. As you walk, tie a band of surveyor’s tape at eye level around a tree, fence post or other feature. If
moving through a field, use the highest plant you can find.
 c. Ensure the tape is visible from all directions.
 d. Place tape at intervals where you can always see the next band from the previous one, in either
direction. Tie bands more frequently as the terrain restricts visibility.
 e. Slow the search line down as necessary in order to have time to leave good marks. Do not get in a
hurry and do a poor marking job.

CONDUCT INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS ON LOCATING A CLUE
## CONDITIONS
You are moving as part of a search team when you discover a clue.
OJECTIVES
Demonstrate the appropriate actions on finding a clue
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. If an individual team member spots a clue relating to the search ## OBJECTIVE (missing aircraft or person), the
primary concern is to relay this information to mission base. Mission base can then re-prioritize search
resources based on the new information. Clues are found during ground searches, ramp checks, distress beacon
searches, and witness interviews.
2. The actions that an individual team member would take are the same no matter what the source of the clue.
 a. Halt in place. On a ground search, immediately call "Halt the line" and ensure that the search team
stops in place.
 b. Alert the team leader of a possible clue find and your position on the line.
 c. From your position visually survey the surrounding area for safety hazards such as falling tree limbs,
wreckage, etc.
 d. Do not disturb anything in the area or disturb the clue in anyway. If it is clothing, do not pick it up as
your scent on it will interfere with search dog resources.
 e. Brief the team leader on what you see and any safety hazards when he arrives at your position.
 f. In the woods, secure the area around the clue with marking tape to keep others away from it.

PARTICIPATE IN A HASTY SEARCH
## CONDITIONS
You are a member of a ground team assigned to perform a hasty search of a specific area.
OJECTIVES
Search an assigned area with minimal assistance and report back to the team leader with the results.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. In the course of conducting a search ground team are often broken up into smaller teams of qualified
personnel to search very specific areas. Typically this team is made up of two or three personnel with advanced
training to be able to assist survivors if found before a full team arrives. The suggested make-up of this team is:
 a. A qualified Ground Team Leader. This person may be serving as the assistant team leader for the
larger team, but has the necessary skills to lead the team if necessary.
 b. A Communicator. This person has the skills to communicate effectively with the larger team and
mission base as necessary including finding better locations to transmit from.
 c. A Medic, First Responder or other higher qualified medical person. This person must have the basic
skills to handle the initial medical problems encountered in victims before the larger team or local EMS arrives.
2. Many searches are resolved via hasty searches of "hot spots" assigned by the mission coordinator. Examples
of these hot spots include:
 a. Trails, fire roads, or other access points to the area of high probability.
 b. Streams, rivers, drainages, lake edges and other runoff points.
 c. Routes towards known gathering places.
 d. Known visited places by the missing.
e. Common aircraft accident locations.
f. Other logical places the missing might go.
3. It is essential that this team maintain adequate communications. Though this team could probably deal with
incidents effectively for the short term, members could easily be overwhelmed by tasks necessary to
accomplishing the mission. Quick and effective requests for assistance should be accomplished as soon
possible on finding the ## OBJECTIVE. Don't be a hero, lives are at stake.

PLAN SEARCH LINE OPERATIONS
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a team in the field, and are assigned to grid search an area.
## OBJECTIVE
Conduct an effective team grid search of the assigned area.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. The ground search function is the most physically demanding and trying operation that a ground team must
be prepared to conduct. This is where ground team leaders spend most of their training time and leadership
ability. In order to effectively search an area, the team leader must make several decisions based on his
assignment, the time available, and his team.
2. Team Leaders will usually be given a section of ground to search and a briefing on how thoroughly the area
must be searched. The particulars of actually performing the operation are at the discretion of the team leader
based on his evaluation of the terrain, visibility, and his team. The team leader needs to decide:
 a. What search pattern to use
 b. What search formation to use
 c. What interval to have between team members
 d. From what directions to sweep the search area.
 e. Where the team is to stop, turn, or regroup.
 f. Panic direction if a team member gets lost
 g. What hazards to avoid in the area
3. SEARCH PATTERNS. The terrain will usually dictate what search pattern is used to sweep an area. The
most common ones are:

 a. The creeping line - is the most commonly used pattern. The team starts in one corner of the search
area, proceeds to the adjacent corner, offsets the line and proceeds across the search area.
 b. The expanding rectangle - is used for small search areas where the target is believed to be and a high
probability of detection is desired. To execute this pattern requires extremely good compass/mapwork, pace
counting, and blazing abilities. The modified expanding rectangle is used when the search area is on one side of
a linear feature such as a road or river. If a repeated search is made, the center position should be made
diagonally from the first leg. This type of search pattern is often used after a clue is found. 
O-0416 31-JAN-01
 c. Spiral - or contour pattern is used when the search area encompasses a hill or mountain. The team
starts at the top and spirals down and outward according to the contour of the land. Again this pattern requires a
high degree of orienteering skill.
 d. Route - searches are frequently for missing person searches. The GSAR team will be instructed to
search along roads or trails as they represent high probability areas. To do this the team splits into two sections
to cover both sides of the road. The team leader walks along the road in a position where he can control both
flanks.
4. SEARCH FORMATIONS. There are three ## OBJECTIVE search formations used: the line, contour and wedge.
 a. Line (sometimes referred to as a skirmish line): x x x x x x x x
 x
The skirmish line is used in open, flat terrain or when there is a large number of search team members on the
line. The team leader positions himself far enough in the rear to maintain control over the entire line. For large
lines, it may be necessary to assign squad leaders to control part of the line while the team leader directs the
squad leaders. Usually the most experienced searchers are the ends and center of the line or are scouts sent
ahead to warn the team leader of upcoming hazards.
 b. Contour (or Echelon): x
 x
 x ---> Higher Ground in this direction
 x x
 x

The echelon or contour pattern is used on hilly steep terrain, with the line of searchers conforming to the
contour of the ground. This formation ensures that rubble dislodged members on higher ground does not roll
down and strike other members. Again the team leader positions himself where he can best control the line.
Guidelines concerning placement of experienced members and squad leaders still apply.
 c. Wedge (or double echelon):
 x
 x x
 x x
 x x x
The double echelon or inverted V formation is used in flat, wooded or overgrown terrain. It's advantages are
that the team leader maintains better control over the team members and the area is better covered by
overlapping lines of sight.
5. SEARCH INTERVAL. The search coverage factor or probability of detection for a sortie will usually be
assigned by the ground search coordinator. This number is usually based on how far apart searchers are spaced
on a line. However; in the field it is extremely difficult to judge how many feet or meters to separate people and
to maintain this exact separation as a team moves through varying terrain. To solve this the team leader can base
his decision on how far apart to separate his searchers based on the terrain and visibility according to the
following rules of thumb:
a. Spacing team members such that when on line any given team member can barely see only the team
member to his left or right gives approximately a 50% probability of detection. 
O-0416 31-JAN-01
b. Spacing team members such that when on line any given team member can barely see the team
member two positions to his left or right gives approximately a 75-80% probability of detection.
 c. Spacing team members such that when on line any given team member can barely see the team
member three positions to his left or right gives approximately a 95% probability of detection.
Using these rules allows the team leader to expand or contract his team spacing as required to maintain the
assigned POD through varying terrain.
6. SEARCH DIRECTION. An important decision is from what direction to head the team in order to cover the
area. In flat terrain, almost any direction will do, so the team leader can choose the long axis of his search area
to minimize turning points or choose to follow surrounding roads as guides. In hilly terrain, it is best to search
along the contour of the ground. Trying to search up and down hill will unnecessarily fatigue team members. A
search direction may already be assigned by the ground branch director, particularly if the area has been
previously searched in another direction.
7. HAZARDS. Before starting a search the team leader must conduct at least a map study and if possible a
quick inspection of the assigned area for terrain hazards. Team members should be briefed on all hazards they
can expect to encounter to including: rock fields, cliffs, thick underbrush, mine shafts, etc.
8. ‘PANIC’ AZIMUTH. The team leader must also pick the points or terrain features that determine where his
team is to stop searching and turn in a different direction. Also determine a compass azimuth that will lead an
individual out of the search area in a safe direction, preferably toward a linear feature. Team members are
briefed on this 'panic azimuth' and told to follow it if they become lost.
### Additional Information

Leader Reference Text.
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Provide the team leader with a map the search area. A topographical map is preferable, or a copy of

ORGANIZE A SEARCH LINE
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a team in the field, and are assigned to grid search an area. You have already planned how you
will search the area.
## OBJECTIVE
Organize the assigned team members into a search line and brief them on the search.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Before a team moves through the woods on a search, the team members must be organized into an effective
unit rather than a bunch of individuals. The team leader must perform this organization and brief his people
with the required knowledge to properly perform their jobs.
2. The team leader should perform the following actions:
 a. Line team members up in the required search formation. Assign post numbers to each individual.
 b. Assign team members to mark the search route. Usually one or both end members of the line (also
usually the most experienced team members). Check to make sure marking materials are available, and instruct
on what colors to use.
 c. Assign team members to the roles of the base man (either compass bearer or terrain feature follower)
and pace keeper (if required). Remember, the team leader is still responsible for determining the team’s
location. The compass and pace keepers are there as backups.
 d. Assign a team member to be the communicator (if the team leader doesn't perform this function), and
team members to carry first aid kits, rope, etc. Take into account the skills and carrying capacity of the team
members.
 e. Determine where the team leader will position himself. A team leader can be centered on and behind
the team for maximum control, with the base man in order to direct the teams movement, or in front as a scout.
 f. Brief the team on the following items:
 1) The chain of command for the team (who’s in charge if the team leader is absent or injured).
 2) Search interval and pattern
 3) Turning and end points of travel
 4) Terrain hazards and panic azimuth
 5) Actions on clue find or target find.

CONTROL A SEARCH LINE
## CONDITIONS
You are a ground team leader. You have planned and organized a search line, and are preparing to begin the
search.
## OBJECTIVES
 Conduct a proper search, maintaining proper direction, interval and speed, while keeping track of your
position.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Proper control of a search line is essential to ensure proper coverage of the search area. It is the team
leader’s responsibility to ensure that all the terrain in the search area is searched to a given degree of
thoroughness. The team leader does this by ensuring the team maintains the proper direction, interval and
speed. Additionally, the team leader ensures that no terrain is missed between sweeps. Finally, the team leader
must also ensure that safety of the team at all times.
2. To control the team:
 a. Position yourself where you can best control the team. Normally this is centered on and behind the
search line. Sometimes you might choose to travel in front of the search line, scouting out possible hazards.
Occasionally, the you should travel along the search line to supervise all team members. Only on the smallest
teams should the team leader be part of the search line. THE TEAM LEADER IS NOT A SEARCHER. While
you should keep your eyes open, your primary duty is controlling the team, not scanning.
 b. Normally uses whistle signals or voice commands (“Forward the Line”, “Halt the Line, etc.), although
radios can sometimes be used, especially on a long search line.
3. To maintain proper direction:
 a. When navigating off a terrain feature or marked path. While you should have appointed a base man
to follow the terrain feature or marked path, you must double check the base man occasionally with a map and
compass. The team leader, not the base man, is ultimately responsible for the direction of the team.
 c. If you are navigating by azimuth and distance, use your own compass to double check the base man.
Periodically ask the pace man for the total distance traveled, and mark it on the map, using terrain association to
see if it is correct.
4. To maintain proper interval: You should monitor you team for correct interval and make corrections as
needed. As you walk the line, stand by each team member and see if you can see the number of other team
members to either side specified by the interval.
5. To maintain proper speed: 
O-0418 31-JAN-01
 a. You should look for parts of the line that are moving too quickly and slow them down. If the whole
line’s speed needs adjusting, adjust the speed of the base man accordingly.
 b. Watch the designated route marker - he is the most likely to fall behind. Slow the team if necessary
to ensure a well-marked edge.

 c. Occasionally stop the team for listening checks or whistle sound sweeps.
6. To ensure no terrain is missed between sweeps:
 a. Make sure the team member marking the edge of the search line .is marking at the proper interval
(you can see each mark from the last one).
 b. When you make subsequent sweeps, let the same person who marked a line be the new base man.
He will have the easiest time finding the marks since he left them.
 c. If you have problems finding a mark, stop the line and send out scouts to find it. Once you do, ensure
you haven’t missed any terrain while looking for the mark. If so, back up and cover it.
 d. Periodically check your pace man’s count and locate your approximate location on the map.
 e. Periodically check the map, and mark the areas you have covered.

7. To ensure team safety. 
O-0418 31-JAN-01
 a. Occasionally have the team “Count Off” with their numbers. This ensures you haven’t lost anyone.
 b. Monitor your team for fatigue or dehydration. Take breaks as needed.
 c. If you hit dangerous terrain, stop the team, recon area, and make a safe plan to search or avoid it.
 d. Ensure all team members know they can halt the team for any reason related to the search or safety.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Choose a wooded area at least 400 meters long with a linear terrain feature (stream, road, etc.).Line up a
search team of at least 5 members. Predesignate a base man, pace man, and an edge marker. Provide a map of
the area to the individual to be tested. Choose a magnetic azimuth through a different part of the woods.
Brief Team Leader: Tell the individual to take the team and search the area to one side of the linear terrain
feature using a search interval of 2 men visible. Tell him to search a given distance along the feature, then turn
around and search coming back one search line width farther from the terrain feature. When he completes that
task, tell him to search along the magnetic azimuth for 400 meters. At some point along each search, have him
stop the team and determine his position on the map +/- 100 meters.

PLAN AND ORGANIZE A HASTY SEARCH
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a team in the field, and are assigned to hasty search trails and linear features in an area.
## OBJECTIVES
Within 10 minutes, plan and organize an effective team hasty search of the assigned area.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Efficiency is important to cover a large search area quickly. It takes many searchers a long time to search
one square mile, especially in a line search, and it is not wise to waste resources this way when many survivors
are found by searching high probability areas. This could be because the search target is believed to be mobile
and looking for help, or because the search target is believed to be located near a road or other terrain feature.
The ## OBJECTIVE of a hasty search is to search areas of high probability in an area quickly to a moderate probability
of detection. Areas of high probability include linear features like trails, roads, streams, and drainages, and point
features like cliffs, boulder fields, caves, etc.
 a. Team movement during a hasty search is normally on trails and roads. Vehicles may be used on
some roads, while team members walk on smaller trails.
 b. In order to cover more area, the team leader often will be required to operate the team in two to threemember sections remotely from your location. This requires additional care to keep all team members safe.
 c. Hasty search usually involves attraction tasks, such as yelling, horn blowing, lights at night, etc. (See
the Conduct Attraction Techniques task O-0407.)
 d. Sometimes, the team will be told exactly what terrain features to search. Other times, the team will
be given an area to cover, and the team leader chooses where to search.
2. To plan and organize a hasty search:
 a. Determine what linear and point features to search (unless this is specified) using a map. Take
into account the past history of the area, preliminary information from investigations, and the possibility that
you may be looking for someone that isn't lost, but just delayed: a "bastard" search.
 1) Linear features within a search area include trails, ridge lines, drainages, and roads. These
are normally places the search target might be walking (like roads), obstacles a plane might have crashed into
(ridge lines), or places that allow visibility of surrounding terrain.
 2) Point features are specific points of interest. They could also include isolated buildings,
bridges, or other places the search target may have taken shelter. They could be high points from which a team
can visually scan the area. Or they could be danger areas that might have caused the target to become lost or
injured (cliffs and caves for missing persons, towers and mountain tops for airplanes). 
O-0419 31-JAN-01
 3) Remember what your target is. A missing plane search will look at different terrain features
than a missing persons search.
 b. Determine the hazards in the area (see separate task -- Identify Natural Hazards - O-0101), so you
can brief your team.
 c. Divide the team into sections of two to three team members.
 1) The ability to divide the team into sections is determined by the number of people and the
ability to maintain communications with each section. The buddy system requires that no person be sent out
alone, so the maximum number of sections is simply half the number of team members.. The team member may
choose to make three person sections based on the assignment and the experience level of the team members.
 2) Ideally each section will have radio communications with the team leader, but this is not an
absolute requirement. Being in whistle range should be adequate for short periods of time.
 3) Determine who will carry what team equipment, including the first aid kit, DF gear, and
radios.
 d. Determine the rally point. Where should sections go when they are done searching. It might be the
start point, or it might be some other place in the area.
 e. Determine who searches what features. Divide the work up evenly. Starting from the team’s
current location and trace routes for each team to the rally point. Decide if each team travels mounted or
dismounted. Remember to allow more time for teams moving through rough terrain (such as “ridge running”)
than for teams traveling on well kept roads.
 e. Make a communications plan. How do sections communicate -- radio or whistle? Ensure sections
are always in at least whistle range of other sections. Determine check-in times and procedures with the team
leader. This can be done with whistle signals.
 f. Determine lost procedures. If there is a clearly definable terrain feature, such as a tower, that is
visible from all directions, you could have lost team members move to that feature. If there is a linear terrain
feature at or beyond a boundary of the search area (such as a river or highway), you could determine the
azimuth to it, and have lost team members travel to it and then stop. At the very least, you could have lost
personnel stationary on the trail they are on. In any case, have a plan.
 g. Brief your sections. The briefing should include the results of all your planning. . Make each
section knows exactly where to search. If maps are not available for all, drawing sketches is desirable. Brief the
team on:
 1) The chain of command for the team (who’s in charge if the leader is absent or injured).
 2) Who is in what section, and who carries what team gear.
 3) Exactly what routes each section takes, and what they search.
 4) The communications plan
 5) Terrain hazards and lost procedures 
O-0419 31-JAN-01
 6) Actions on clue find or target find.
 7) Where the team leader will be located.
 8) Specific clues to search for (remind the team what the target is).
 9) Attraction techniques to use.
3. To conduct the hasty search, each section travels along its route, using proper scanning techniques. At point
terrain features, the section stops and searches the point and it’s surrounding area.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Provide the team leader with a map with an area to search marked on it. The leader may use any item
in his field gear, including this checklist. Prepare a list of team equipment.
Brief Team Leader: Tell the team leader that he has an 8 man team (including himself) and must develop a plan
for a hasty search of the marked area. Brief the team leader on what the target of the search is. Give him the
list of team equipment. Tell him to brief you on his plan in 15 minutes as if you were his team.

PERFORM AN AIRFIELD SEARCH (RAMP CHECK)
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a ground team that has been tasked to search an airfield and have just arrived at the airfield.
## OBJECTIVES
Take all steps necessary to determine if the missing aircraft is at this airport.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. During a missing aircraft search, one of the first priorities of the mission is to investigate airfields in the
surrounding area. This investigation is to determine if the missing aircraft may have landed, refueled, or stopped
over to avoid weather. Missing planes can be found at the wrong airport for many reasons. The pilot might
have landed successfully and gone about his business, not realizing that people are looking for him. Sometimes,
aircraft crash near an airport they were trying to land at, or just took off from.
2. Your team may be tasked to search one or more airfields, or you may come across an airfield during a
search. In either case, you should follow the following steps:
 a. Contact the Owner. The first priority is to contact the airfield owner/operator or fixed base operator
(FBO). This individual will permit you access to controlled airfields and will also be helpful in obtaining any
records. If no FBO is present, you may proceed to search the airfield within the limits of safety and trespassing
laws.
 b. Brief your people. Make sure all your team members know what the missing aircraft looks like, and
what it’s tail number is. Remind them of possible search clues, including
 1) The missing plane itself.
 2) Any plane that comes close to the description (it’s possible your briefing at mission base
contained an error)
 3) Any clues that a plane might have crashed near the airport, such as bad weather in the vicinity
at the time the plane was lost, trees knocked down, people reporting hearing/seeing something strange, etc. See
Task O-0408 - Identify Aircraft Search Clues for more details.
 c. Conduct the search. Have your team conduct the following search actions (you may divide your
team up as you see fit, making sure that inexperienced members are teamed with more experienced members):
 1) Check records. Check any landing/take-off records at the airport for information on the
missing aircraft. Also check any fuel purchase logs. Look for the tail number of the plane you are looking for.
 2) Conduct Interviews. Interview people at the airport (See Task O-1101 - Conduct Witness
Interview). Airport workers, maintenance personnel, or perhaps somebody just ‘hanging around’ may have seen
the missing aircraft or know someone who might have seen it. All of these types of leads must be thoroughly 
O-0420 17-MAR-04
investigated. Continue to conduct interviews over time - people come and go at airfields all the time, and the
person who saw the search target might not be there when you arrive.
 3) Check the flight line. Have personnel walk down the flight line / tarmac and check the
registration numbers on all aircraft parked on the airfield. Look into hangars and check numbers. Each of these
should be conducted within regulations and local laws. If on a controlled airport, notify ground control and/or
operations before entering operational areas like the ramps and hangars. Use good judgment in deciding to
enter hangars or aircraft; you are not normally going to find a person in distress within a hangar or parked
airplane, so waiting for law enforcement personnel, the aircraft owner, or the FBO to open it is totally
reasonable.
 e. Leave a phone number. If the search results are negative, leave the mission base phone number and
a contact name (normally the incident commander) with the FBO. Request that he continue asking about the
missing aircraft to people who come into the airport. Any information that he develops can then be forwarded
directly to mission base. Note: Do not leave the airfield until you receive permission from mission base.
### Additional Information
More detailed information on this topic is available in Chapters 7, 18, and 19 of the Ground Team Member and
Leader Reference Text. 
O-0420 17-MAR-04
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Prepare a diagram of an airfield (or conduct the test at an actual airfield). Prepare a description of a
missing aircraft and its pilot as well as the incident commander’s name and phone number. The team leader
may use any equipment in his field gear (including this guide).
Brief Team Leader: Verbally brief the team leader on the missing aircraft. Tell him that he has a ground team
consisting of himself, one other senior (GTM qualified) and 5 cadets (3 GTM, 2 Trainee). Tell the team leader
to describe, in sequence how he will search the airport. Tell him that you will play the role of the FBO. After
he has described the search, tell him he did not find the plane, and ask him what he would do now.

 DIRECT TEAM ACTIONS ON LOCATING A CLUE
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a search team moving when a team member discovers the possible search clue.
## OBJECTIVES
Direct your team through the necessary actions to protect the clue, and search the immediate area for additional
clues.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. When a team member discovers a possible clue, the team leader must direct the team actions properly in
order to prevent the clue from being disturbed, preventing destruction of other possible clues in the area, find
any other clues in the area, and report the information to mission base.
2. When a team member spots a clue, they will halt the team and alert the team leader. The team leader should
then:
 a. Ensure the team is halted.
 b. Move to the team member who found the clue.
 c. Survey the immediate area for safety hazards such as falling debris, rotting tree limbs, pits and holes,
etc., and for other clues in the immediate area.
 d. Protect the clue: Have a team member mark off the immediate area with flagging tape. Neither the
team leader nor members should actually touch nor disturb the clue. This will allow man-trackers, dog teams,
etc. to work with an undisturbed source.
 e. Search the immediate area. Based on the initial survey, search the area around the clue in order to
detect any other possible clues in the area. Search carefully, because the ## OBJECTIVE is to find other clues without
significantly disturbing the area. If necessary, call other team members over to assist. Ensure they know of any
safety hazards, and where the clue(s) are (so they do not disturb them). Usually the best plan is to have two or
three experienced people sweep the area around the clue location while the rest of the team remains off to the
side.
 f. Report the clue to mission base. Follow any instructions they give you.
 g. On a high visibility marker by the clue, record the time, date, and clue number (based upon a standard
issue log). In the team log, record the time, date, clue number, location, and description of the clue.
 h. Do not leave the area until directed by mission base.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Pick a piece of terrain and put a clue (article of clothing, piece of aircraft debris, etc.) on the ground.
Ensure the team leader has his field gear. Place the team leader at least 20 yards from the clue. Position
yourself at the clue. (As an option, you can place another clue nearby to be found in the subsequent search of
the area.)
Brief Team Leader: Brief the ground team leader that he is leading a team on a search. Tell him that you will
play the role of a team member who has just spotted a clue. Tell him to take all necessary actions. Finally,
inform him that that you will also play the roles of all team members and mission base, if he wants to call them
on the radio (simulate radio traffic).

DIRECT TEAM ACTIONS ON FIND
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a ground team when one of your team members discovers the search target.
## OBJECTIVES
Direct team actions to identify the target, provide first aid, and protect your team.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. At the point when an individual team member first sights the object of a SAR mission, the search phase ends
and the rescue and recovery phase begins. In this process, the safety of the search ## OBJECTIVE and your team are
the primary concern.
2. If a team member discovers the search target, you, the team leader, should:
 a. Halt the Team. Have everyone remain in place. You should only call personnel in to the scene as
they are needed. Be especially sensitive to exposing younger cadets to accident sites.
 b. Assess the Situation. Move to the search target. As you approach, survey the surrounding area for
safety hazards such as falling tree limbs, wreckage, fires, hazardous materials, etc. Do not put your team in
danger.
 c. Provide Life Saving first aid. Direct your medically trained personnel to aid the injured to the extent
of your team members’ training. Ensure anyone who comes in contact with the victims or the crash site takes
appropriate protective measures against blood borne pathogens. Leave obviously deceased personnel alone.
Determine if you need outside agency assistance, such as an ambulance, helicopter, or coroner. Whenever
practical, use ambulances or helicopters for evacuation of the injured - don’t do it yourself.
 d. Positively identify the target. Make sure you’ve found what you think you’ve found. Verify the
tail number off the airplane, ask conscious survivors their names, and check physical descriptions against your
mission briefing. If you haven’t found all the missing persons, organize a hasty search of the surrounding
terrain. Ask victims where the others are.
 e. Send a Report to Mission Base. Advise the mission base of your situation. Once your team medics
are at work and you know what you have, send a find report. If you are still searching for some victims, make
that a part of your report. If you find them, you can always update your report.
 f. Assist Local Authorities - Establish a staging area on the nearest road, post a team member there,
and let mission base know where it is. If necessary, establish a separate entry-control point. Depending on the
location of the staging area, you may not need a separate entry control point from the staging area. Either way,
until the scene is turned over to another agency, you are responsible for documenting who or what enters or
exits the site. Be prepared to assist the local fire department, medical examiner, FAA or NTSB representatives
as required. This includes establishing traffic control points, area security, or assisting in the evacuation of
survivors and victims. Any requests for assistance beyond the team leaders instructions from ground operations
must be approved by the mission coordinator prior to rendering assistance. 
O-0422 17-MAR-04
 g. Safeguard the Area. Assign at least two members of the team to sweep the entire area to determine
the extent of the crash site. Use other team members to establish an initial perimeter around the site for security.
Don’t disturb any wreckage except as required to save lives. See Task O-0802 - Plan and Organize Site
Surveillance.

PARTICIPATE IN A LITTER OR STRETCHER CARRY
## CONDITIONS
As part of team you are required to evacuate a patient from a wilderness environment using a litter or stretcher.
OJECTIVES
Participate as part of a litter team to properly evacuate a simulated patient from the wilderness over several
obstacles.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. At times the ground search and rescue team will be required to assist in the transportation of a patient from a
remote location to medical assistance. This is usually done by placing the patient in a stretcher or litter and
having a six to eight person team manually transport them to safety. As part of the team, the individual is
responsible for knowing how to lift, carry, pass the litter, and set the patient down properly.
2. Litter lifting. Once the patient is in the litter and secured, the team must bring the litter to waist height to
begin transport.
 a. To do this four to six individuals line up on alongside the litter (two or three per side), the person at
the right front (head position) is in charge of the lift. All individuals get down on one knee facing the litter.
Grab the litter rail with both hands.
 b. On the command "lift to the knees," straighten your back and lift with both hands, pulling the litter
up to knee height.
 c. On the command "lift to the waist," use your rear leg to lever yourself to a standing position, with
both hands still on the litter.
3. Litter Carry.
 a. After the litter is lifted, the team leader commands 'face front.' At this point take your front hand off
the litter and rotate your body to face the front (head) of the litter.
 b. On the command 'forward', start walking with your inside foot first. Ideally the people on each side
of the litter are 'out of step with each other,' to avoid bouncing the litter, but moving the litter should not be
stopped to simply stay in step.
 c. If you tire and need relief, alert the team leader. A relief bearer will come up directly behind you and
grab the litter. When he tells you that he has 'got the litter' you may let go and move off to the side. At this point
you join the pool of relief bearers.
4. Pass over obstacles. Fences, rocks, or fallen logs represent obstacles to properly carrying the litter. To
overcome these:
 a. The team leader brings the litter directly up to the obstacle and halts the team. 
O-0502 31-JAN-01
 b. Two relief bearers cross the obstacle and position themselves at the head. The litter is passed forward
to so that the relief bearers take over the front of the litter.
 c. The bearers at the rear of the litter who just passed their load forward, then cross the obstacle and
position themselves in front of the relief bearers.
 d. The litter is again passed forward until the only the rear of the litter is on the obstacle.
 e. The process is repeated until the litter and all the bearers are passed the obstacle and normal travel
can resume.
Litter Transfer Uphill or Over an Obstacle
5. This same technique should be used when moving up or down a steep slope (whenever possible, however,
avoid such slopes). Ropes can be secured to the litter to allow personnel at the top of the slope to assist in the
movement up or downhill.
6. Setting the litter down
 a. To set the litter down, the team leader calls a halt and then 'face center.' At this point the bearers
rotate their bodies to face into the litter and grab the litter rails with both hands.
 b. The team leaders then command 'lower to the knees.' At this point keep your back straight and lower
yourself to a kneeling position with the litter in front of you and at knee height.
 c. On the command 'lower to the ground,' bend forward slightly until the litter is safely on the ground.
At this point move away from the litter to allow the team medic to check out the patient.
6. Lift straps. If you have a length of 1" webbing in your gear, it may be easier on your arms to construct a
sling to help carry the litter. Tie a water knot in the webbing to secure the ends together. Girth hitch or snaplink
the webbing to the litter rail and place the long loop over your shoulder. Adjust the position of the water knot to
set the loop to the proper length. On long evacuations, this will reduce fatigue.

CONDUCT ACTIONS WHEN LOST
## CONDITIONS
You have become separated from your ground team in the wilderness, and do not know where they are or where
you are.
OJECTIVES
Take correct actions needed to survive and be found.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Search and rescue operations are frequently conducted in adverse weather and terrain ## CONDITIONS. The same
environment that caused the search ## OBJECTIVE to be missing could cause the same difficulties for a team member.
All ground team members should have a knowledge of basic survival skills. This will decrease the chances of
serious injuries and decrease the time before the team member can be found.
2. If you are in a survival situation, remember the acronyms SURVIVAL or STOP:

 a. SURVIVAL:
 1) Size up the situation. Look at where you are. What resources (water, wood, etc.) are
available nearby? What dangers are there? (see task O-0101 - Identify Natural Hazards.) Inventory your
equipment to establish what tools you have to handle the situation. Are there people nearby who might be able
to help you? For example, if you just became separated from you team, just blowing your whistle might rescue
you. (See task O-0406 - Use Whistle Signals)
 2) Undue Haste Makes Waste. STOP. Walking around aimlessly is a waste of energy. Take
your time and think about your decisions. You could easily make the situation worse by moving farther from
help, injuring yourself, or losing an important item.
 3) Remember Where You Are. You may not be as lost as you think, just momentarily
disoriented. Think about the last time you knew where you were, and what happened next. Mark your current
location, and memorize it. That way, as you look around, you will not become more lost.
 4) Vanquish Fear and Panic. These feelings are natural, but might lead you to do something that
you have not thought through clearly. If you are tired, frustrated, or near panic, stop and rest. Provide your
body and mind with a few minutes or hours of down time. This will help to calm anxieties and better prepare
you to handle the situation. Keep a positive mental attitude -- believe you are going to be all right.
 5) Improve Your Situation. Think about how to be found, safe from danger, and more
comfortable.
 a) Find a clear area. This will facilitate your being spotted from the air.
 b) Establish shelter for your body. If you have to spend the night in the wilderness, spend
the necessary time to build adequate shelter and a fire. Maintaining body warmth and protection is a high
priority. 
O-0601 17-MAR-04
 c) Establish signals. Place orange markers or vests in nearby location. Preferably where
they can be seen from the air. Do not forget Ground to Air Signals (task O-0703). Build a large signal fire.
Establish a schedule for blowing your whistle to attract anybody in the area. If you are moving at night, stay in
the open. Tie your chem-lite to the end of a string and swing it in a circle over your head. This will make you
easy to spot from the air, and make it easy for the pilots to tell the difference between you and the lights of the
ground searchers looking for you.
 d) Find water. If you are in a wilderness area, remember that downhill always leads to
water. Do not drink standing water, build a fire and boil it at least one minute to remove bacteria. Rain water,
melting snow or ice will provide adequate bacteria-free water.
 e) If you have to move, remember that downhill and downstream leads to civilization.
Moving uphill will rarely lead you to any help.
 6) Value Living. Never stop trying. Giving up is the surest way to ensure failure. No matter
how cold, wet, or tired you get, do not forget that positive mental attitude. Never give up!
 7) Act Like the Natives. Observe animals in the area. They live here -- they know where the
where food and water are, and what the dangers are. (be careful what you eat, though. Some plants are
poisonous to people but harmless to animals.)
 8) Learn Basic Skills. And use them. This book is full of them. Make sure you know how to
build a fire, avoid hazards, build a shelter, signal for help, and find water.
 b. STOP:
 1) Stay where you are. Rather than wandering aimlessly, don't move unless it is more hazardous
to stay where you are than to move.
 2) Think before acting rashly. If something does not seem right, it probably isn't. If you take
the time to stop and think, you may come up with a better solution.
 3) Observe your surrounding and its' inhabitants. Animals survive on natural instinct experience
in their surroundings. By observing their habits, and in many cases mimicking them, you will survive.
 4) Plan for the worst. Most people who do not survive had the tools and the knowledge to
survive, but got caught off guard and didn't do anything about it. If you plan for the worst using what you have,
you will at least be ready, and kept your mind off of being lost and re-focused your energy on living.
3. If you ever end up in a survival situation, remember that a Positive Mental Attitude will save you. If you
don't want to live, then most of what you do will be a waste of time, but if you really do want to live then you
have a chance. There are many stories of people that should have died days earlier being rescued and returning
to happy and healthy lives long after the normal person dies. And there are obviously many other of people
who died that shouldn't have. Stay focused, and tell yourself you want to live!

EXTINGUISH A SMALL FIRE
## CONDITIONS
You have come across a small fire.
## OBJECTIVES
Safely extinguish the fire.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Fire burns in two basic modes: flaming and surface combustion (or smoldering). The surface or smoldering
fire is represented by the fire triangle with the three sides representing fuel, heat and oxygen. Flaming
combustion is represented by the fire tetrahedron (pyramid) with the four sides representing fuel, heat, oxygen
and an uninhibited chemical chain reaction.
Fire Triangle Fire Pyramid (unfolded)
2. The fuel portion of either type of fire may be solid, liquid or gas. Oxygen may be that present in the air or in
another solid, liquid or gaseous chemical which contains oxygen (an oxidizer). Combustion (fire) starts when
there is the proper mixture of oxidizer, fuel and either heat or a chemical reaction.
3. To extinguish a fire, the triangle or pyramid must be broken by:
a. removing the fuel or
b. removing the oxygen or
c. reducing the heat or
d. interfering with the chemical reaction.
4. The most common method of extinguishing a fire is by reducing the heat, in other words, cooling the fire,
using water. This is most effective on common combustibles such as wood and paper.
5. Cooling will not work on flammable liquids such as gasoline and grease. To extinguish fires such as these,
the fuel must be removed (such as closing a valve to stop the flow), displacing the oxygen (with a nonflammable gas for instance), or breaking up the chemical reaction with another chemical.

O-0605 17-MAR-04
6. Fires are divided into four classes and fire extinguishers are classified the same to indicate what type of fire
they are effective against:
a. Class A - Common combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth and many plastics. Water works well on
these by cooling them below their ignition points.
b. Class B - Flammable liquids and gases. These must be extinguished by smothering (removing the
oxygen), displacing the oxygen, removing the fuel or breaking up the chemical reaction.
c. Class C - Fires involving energized electrical equipment. Although there are special extinguishing
agents for these, it is normally easiest to de-energize the circuit (turn off the power), then put out the resulting
Class A or B fire.
d. Class D - Flammable metals. These are rare and require special techniques to extinguish.
7. Fire extinguishers also have a numerical rating which indicates the relative size fire it will extinguish. A 4A
extinguisher will put out a Class A fire twice as big as a 2A extinguisher can and 4 times the size that a 1A
extinguisher can extinguish.
8. The most common type of extinguisher is an ABC, with the most versatile being a 4A-20B:C (the C has no
rating, it just indicates that the extinguishing agent is non-conductive). This type of extinguisher is effective
against most small fires in a home or vehicle.
9. To use a fire extinguisher:
a. Make sure it is appropriate to the type of fire: A, B or C.
b. Make sure the fire is small. This means that if the extinguisher fails to put out the fire, you must be
able to safely escape. If in doubt, retreat and call 9-1-1.
c. Start on the upwind side of the fire.
d. Follow the letters PASS:
P = PULL the pin at the top of the extinguisher that keeps the handle from being pressed. There is
usually a wire or plastic tab that keeps the pin from falling out. This can easily be broken just by pulling
on the pin. Then check the gauge. If it does not show a full charge, it should not be used because the
effectiveness may be greatly degraded.
A = AIM the nozzle towards the fire. If the nozzle is at the end of a hose attached to the body of the
extinguisher, detach the hose before aiming the nozzle.
S = SQUEEZE the handle to discharge the extinguishing agent. Use long or short bursts depending on
the fire size and location, aiming at the base of the fire. Carefully move closer if the stream does not
reach the fire.
S = SWEEP the extinguishing stream along the base of the fire. On liquid or grease fires, sweeping just
above the liquid is important, otherwise the burning liquid may be spread around further. Move closer
to the fire as it goes out, circling it if necessary. 
O-0605 17-MAR-04
1) The discharge may only last 30 seconds at the most, so have another extinguisher at the ready
or plan to abandon the effort if the fire is not out.
2) Make sure the fire is out and be prepared for flare-ups.
3) If you don't know what is burning, don't attempt to put out the fire.
4) Don't attempt to extinguish hazardous material fires.
5) Approach burning vehicles from an angle, not head on or in direct line with the tires. When
opening the hood of a vehicle with an engine fire, open it slightly, spray some extinguishing agent in, then open
the hood the rest of the way. Be prepared for flare ups or a flashover.
6) If any doubt exists before or after a fire, notify authorities.
10. To extinguish an outdoor fire such as a campfire or small brushfire:

a. Keep upwind of the fire
b. Have all personnel, vehicles and equipment ready to clear out quickly.
Use water if available. Do not use the drinking water supply if it cannot be easily replenished.
c. Splash, spray or sprinkle water onto the fire, do not pour it on all at once. As the water is put on the
fire, break up big pieces of material if possible, spread out any burning or smoldering material, turning it over to
ensure that all areas are wetted. Continue to add water while disturbing the material until all signs of flame and
glowing embers are extinguished. Dig up or overturn the soil under the burned area to try to mix the ashes into
the soil.
d. Using care, place your hand close to the burned area to ensure that it is cool. If not, add more water
and continue disturbing the material until it is cool.
e. After the fire is out and cool, ensure the burned material is adequately mixed in with the soil.
f. Be prepared for flare-ups.
g. If water is not available, or in combination with water if it is, throw soil, sand, etc. onto the fire while
breaking up, spreading around and disturbing the burning material, mixing it in with the soil.
h. Blankets, coats, shelter halves or similar objects of heavy fabric, not plastic or synthetic, can be used
to extinguish flames by beating directly on the flames to smother them. This must be done directly on the
flames, otherwise this action will fan the flames, causing the fire to grow in intensity. This technique can also
be used in combination with water, and the objects should be wetted if it is.
i. Campfires, signal fires and warming fires must always be completely extinguished and cool to the
touch before leaving them.
j. Efforts to extinguish a brushfire should only be attempted if the fire is very small, there is little or no
wind and an escape route is planned. If in doubt, retreat and notify authorities.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: This exercise should be conducted with a fire protection agency. These agencies will provide instruction
and in most cases, will have a safe area and supplies for igniting training fires and have fire extinguishers for
students to use.
Establish a safe area away from combustibles with backup or alternate extinguishing methods to the one(s) the
students will use. Have a fireproof container in which a small, controlled fire can be ignited, sufficient fuel to
ignite a fire for each student to extinguish an ignition source(s).
NOTE: Fire protection personnel should start the fire and have the student extinguish the fire just built, but
should also be prepared to put out the fire if necessary.
Brief student: Prior to igniting the test fire, the student is to list the four components necessary for fire, what
the basic requirement is to extinguish a fire, the four classes of fire, the types of materials each represents and

RECOGNIZE AND REACT TO AIR/GROUND SIGNALS
## CONDITIONS
You are on a ground team in the field, when a search plane flies overhead and attempts to communicate with
your team without a radio.

OJECTIVES
Recognize what signal the aircraft is giving and react appropriately.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. When on a search, it is possible to communicate with and receive direction from an aircraft that does not
have two-way radio capability with the ground search team. This is accomplished by recognizing the signals
that an aircraft can communicate by using its wings, nose, and engine.
2. The signals are:
 a. Flying directly over the vehicle from rear to front (6 o'clock to 12 o'clock) revving the engine to
indicate to the team to follow that aircraft.
SAR
 b. Aircraft wags wings back and forth (rocking the wings, rolling the aircraft).
 This is a signal that the aircraft receives your message and understands.
 c. Aircraft makes wide right hand turn over team
 This is a signal that the aircraft has received your message but does not understand it.
 d. Aircraft rocks it's nose up and down (pitching) 
O-0701 17-MAR-04
 The aircraft is answering a message as affirmative or 'yes'
 e. Aircraft yaws nose back and forth
 The aircraft is answering a message as negative or 'no'
 f. Aircraft circles the team and then heads away in a straight line while wagging its wings. The aircraft
wants the team to head in that direction. After doing so, if the aircraft makes tight left hand turn over area, the
aircraft is pointing out a specific target area to be searched.
SAR
 g. Flying directly over team from front to rear. This is a signal for the ground team to stop in place and
observe the aircraft for further directions. (12 o'clock position to 6 o'clock positions) to indicate to the ground
team to stop.
SAR
h. The aircraft indicates turns by flying ahead of the team and turning at the appropriate turnoff.
SAR
O-0701 17-MAR-04
 i. The aircraft approaches the vehicle from the rear and then turns sharply right (or left) in front of the
vehicle while in motion to indicate to the team to turn around. The aircraft will circle back as necessary, flying
against the team’s direction of travel, and then take up the initial follow me procedure outlined above. SAR

USE A SIGNAL MIRROR
## CONDITIONS
You are in the field, alone or with your team, in daylight, and need to attract the attention of an overflying
aircraft
OJECTIVES
With a mirror, correctly signal in the direction of an overflying aircraft.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. At times, you may have radio difficulties and need to attract the attention of an aircraft. Even if you have
radio communication with the airplane, the pilot might be having difficulty in spotting you. In daylight, using a
signal mirror is an excellent way to attract a pilot’s attention, or let him know where you are. Mirror signals can
be seen for over 70 miles under normal ## CONDITIONS. Over desert terrain or on the water they can be seen from
over 100 miles. A signal mirror can be a high-tech glass mirror (military MK-3 signal mirror) or just a highly
polished piece of metal. Mirror signals work well even on hazy or overcast days.
2. To use the MK-3 signal mirror:
 a. Outstretch one hand in the direction of the airplane, leaving the palm facing you.
 b. With the mirror, reflect sunlight into the palm your outstretched hand.
 c. Move your outstretched hand out of the way. Slowly bring the mirror up to eye-level and look
through the sighting hole. You will see a bright spot of light. This is the aim indicator.
 d. Hold the mirror near your eye and slowly turn and manipulate it so that the bright spot is on the target
aircraft. If having a tough time lining up on the airplane, the individual might try sighting the mirror between
two fingers on the outstretched hand.
3. To use a polished metal surface:
 a. Outstretch one hand in the direction of the airplane, leaving the palm facing you.
 b. With the mirror, reflect sunlight into the palm your outstretched hand.
 c. Slowly bring the mirror to chest level while maintaining the reflected light on your hand
 d. Move your outstretched hand out of the way. Maneuver the mirror so that the light reflection is in the
direction of the overhead aircraft. Move your hand in and out in front of the beam to create flashes or simply
manipulate the mirror.

EMPLOY GROUND TO AIR SIGNALS
## CONDITIONS
You are in the field and must communicate with an airplane without a radio or signal mirror. You have your
field gear.
OJECTIVES
Identify the appropriate ground to air signal, correctly construct one signal using your field gear and available
materials within 15 minutes, and correctly use body signals
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Ground to air signals can be used by lost personnel and ground teams, whenever a radio is not available. The
international ground to air signals are listed below. There are three types of signals. The five distress signals
are used primarily by lost persons. The seven search team signals are primarily used by ground search teams.
Finally, there are eleven body signals. All team members should memorize the five distress signals, and carry a
reference for the others.
2. To use ground to air signals:
 a. Choose an open area visible from the air.
 b. If possible, draw attention to the area with campfires, smoke, etc.
 c. Construct the signals from any suitable materials, including signal panels, colored cloth (such as tarps
or ponchos), logs, stones, or by digging trenches. The key is contrasting the signal with the background terrain.
 d. Signals should be at least ten feet tall. Each “leg” of the signal should be at least eighteen inches
thick.
 e. The five distress signals are as follows (you can also use the international “S O S”):
- REQUIRE ASSISTANCE
- REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
- NO OR NEGATIVE
- YES OR AFFIRMATIVE
- PROCEEDING IN THIS DIRECTION
O-0703 31-JAN-01
f. The seven ground search team signals are:
- OPERATION COMPLETED
- WE HAVE FOUND ALL PERSONNEL
- WE HAVE FOUND ONLY SOME PERSONNEL
- WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CONTINUE.
 RETURNING TO BASE
- HAVE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (EACH
 PROCEEDING IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED
- INFORMATION RECEIVED THAT AIRCRAFT

PLAN AND ORGANIZE SITE SURVEILLANCE
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a team in the field, and are assigned to conduct surveillance of a site. All victims have been
evacuated. Your team is the first site surveillance team to guard the site.
## OBJECTIVES
Within 30 minutes of arrival (60 at night). Conduct a reconnaissance, establish a hasty perimeter, determine the
final placement of all sentries, mark the perimeter, determine the locations of the command post, parking area
and bivouac area, and brief the first relief.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Site surveillance is a critical CAP mission. The intent is to ensure that the wreckage of an airplane, possible
crime scenes, or other disaster sites are not disturbed by any intruders until investigators (such as NTSB
investigators) arrive or until another agency takes control of the scene. Additionally, site surveillance helps
prevent injury caused by people wandering in to a potentially hazardous crash site that could contain jagged
metal, highly flammable fuel and/or possible contaminated blood.
 a. Conducting site surveillance requires a good deal of planning. The team leader must plan the posting
of sentries and the positioning of vehicles, bivouac areas, and his own command post to ensure that the site is
secure from all directions, that his operation presents a favorable and professional appearance to observers, and
that his own team is safe from any hazards from the crash itself.
 b. Site surveillance is a continuous mission; a team may be constantly “on duty” for 24 hours or longer.
Because of this, a team leader must ensure his plan allows his team adequate rest time to ensure they can sustain
operations until relieved.
 b. The team leader must also remember that his primary ## OBJECTIVE is to ensure the that no one, including
his team, disturbs the wreckage. The only time a team may disturb the wreckage is if it presents a safety hazard
that cannot be avoided any other way or if moving the wreckage would help preserve it (this second situation
does not happen often).
2. When you arrive on the scene:
 a. Determine if there is any other agency already on site. If so, get a full briefing from them and then
relieve them once your sentries are posted.
 b. Conduct a reconnaissance. Take all necessary precautions against bloodborne pathogens (BBP). For
example, if you are the first agency on the scene, conduct the recon wearing full protective gear, if available. If
another agency is on station, determine the BBP threat from them. During the reconnaissance, you are
specifically looking for:
 1) Any safety hazards, including jagged metal, fuel or blood. Remember to look overhead in the
trees for pieces of the wreck that might fall and for any trees that have been dangerously weakened by the crash. 
O-0802 31-JAN-01
 2) The most likely avenues of approach to the crash site that intruders might take, such as trails,
roads or open terrain.
 3) The outline of the crash, formed by the pieces of wreckage furthest from the center.
 4) Places where sentries could have good visibility of the crash site and/or the surrounding
terrain, focusing on likely avenues of approach.
 c. Establish a hasty perimeter. Put sentries around the crash site, outside of all wreckage, and a safe
distance from any hazards found in the reconnaissance.
 d. Mark the perimeter. Use engineers or surveyor’s tape. Put tape as close to waist level as possible.
 e. Determine permanent sentry positions. Sentries can be stationary or roving. In addition to watching
the crash site, sentries can also be used to direct traffic around the site, if near a road. Don’t have too many
sentries at once -- you need multiple shifts. Choose positions that minimize the number of sentries you need.

 f. Determine where you will put:
 1) Your command post. This should be located where you can best control the crash site and
access to it.
 2) The bivouac area. This should be far enough away from the wreck to avoid destroying any
evidence, out of the view of the public (if possible) and where you can easily call for team members as needed.
 3) The parking area. If the crash is near a road, decide where to put your vehicles and where
you will try to keep visitor’s vehicle. Avoid crowding the crash site.
 g. Divide your team into sentry shifts, or “reliefs”. You will need at least two reliefs in the daytime,
and three at night.
 h. Pull your first relief personnel off the perimeter, brief them and post them in the permanent sentry
posts (see separate task O-0803 -- Supervise a Site Surveillance Shift).
 i. At no time should you disturb any piece of the wreckage unless it posses a safety threat. If you must
disturb wreckage, mark its original location and photograph it if possible.

Brief Team Leader: Tell the student that he is the team leader and has been assigned to secure this crash site.
Tell him that all victims have been evacuated, and there is currently no one on site. Inform him that he may
use any checklist, including this book, that he carries in his field gear. Tell him to perform all actions
necessary to plan and organize the CSS. Tell him to you will play the role of all team members. Finally tell
him that in 30 minutes (60 if a BBP protective suit is available and expected to be used) that he must brief you
on his plan.

SUPERVISE A SITE SURVEILLANCE SHIFT
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a team in the field, and are assigned to conduct surveillance of a crashed aircraft, scene of
victim location or other disaster site. All victims have been evacuated. You have already planned your site
surveillance and organized your shifts (relief).
## OBJECTIVES
Correctly, inspect, brief, post, and check your first relief. Politely and correctly deal with potential intruders.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Site surveillance is a critical CAP mission. The intent is to ensure that the wreckage of an airplane, possible
crime scene or other disaster scene is not disturbed by any intruders until investigators (such as NTSB
investigators) arrive or until another agency takes control of the scene. Additionally, site surveillance helps
prevent injury caused by people wandering in to a potentially hazardous site, which contains jagged metal,
highly flammable fuel and/or possible contaminated blood.
 a. Performance of this mission is made more difficult by the fact that CAP may not use any force or
show of force in the execution of it’s duties. Simply put, you cannot keep someone from entering the site if he
wants to. You can inform him of the risks, both legal and safety related, of intruding. You can notify law
enforcement officials. But you cannot physically threaten or restrain anyone.
 b. Another important part of the site surveillance mission is public relations. Site surveillance personnel
are in a “high visibility” position. Bystanders may be getting their first look at the Civil Air Patrol in Action.
Reporters and photographers covering the crash may choose to cover the CAP ground team as well.
 c. In order to accomplish the surveillance mission without the use of force AND present CAP in a
positive light, appearance, politeness and professionalism are essential.
 d. Once you have completed your surveillance plan, you must post your team members, and begin
operations.
2. To post a relief, use the following steps. Each time a new relief comes on duty, go through these steps again.
(Note: if you have enough personnel, you may appoint a sergeant of the guard to inspect, post and directly
supervise the guard shift. However, you as the team leader are still responsible for the site.)
 a. Assemble all members of the relief, preferably at a point where they can observe the site.
 b. Inspect the relief for:
 1) Proper uniforms, and grooming.
 2) Field Gear. Sentries should have all their field gear with them at their posts. At the team
leader’s discretion, they can ground the pack at their post, but they should have all items. Especially check 
O-0803 17-MAR-04
water, rain gear, flashlights and batteries (if at night), whistle, and any other items essential to the sentry
mission.
 3) Knives. No knives should be visible on a sentry’s gear or his person. This could constitute a
show of force.
 4) Knowledge of General Orders.
 c. Brief the relief. Describe your plan. Make sure everyone knows what they are guarding, where all
the guard posts are, where the command post is, and safety issues.
 d. Post the relief. You may take one person at a time to his post, or move the whole relief around the
perimeter, dropping off one person at each post. As you put each person on his post, brief him on the following
items (Note: If there is already a guard at the post whom the new guard is relieving, let the old guard conduct
the briefing.)
 1) Exactly what he will be responsible for guarding
 2) Where he should stand or walk
 3) The guard post number
 4) The locations of all other guard posts (by number)
 5) The location of the team leader (and sergeant of the guard, if assigned)
 6) Any special instructions for this post (for example, "If any cars pull up, tell them the detour is
one mile back on the right.")
 7) Any activity in the area, such as intruders.
 8) Any safety issues, such as sharp objects, holes or spilled fuel in the area.
3. Once the relief is posted:
 a. Make periodic inspections of all posts.
 b. Maintain communications with the mission coordinator, either by radio or periodic phone checks.
 c. If one of your sentries has a potential intruder, you should:
 1) Identify yourself as the team leader.
 2) Politely inform the intruder that to enter the perimeter could be construed as trespassing (you
should explain that this is for their safety and for preserving evidence.).
 3) If the intruder persists, let them know you are summoning local law enforcement. Let them
pass - do not hinder them in any way.
 d. If the press arrives: 
O-0803 17-MAR-04
 1) Escort them to the IO, if present. Otherwise, you, as team leader, act as IO.
 2) Give out no information on the accident or the ## CONDITIONS of the passengers without prior
approval of the PAO or mission coordinator. If they have questions, give them the mission base phone number.
 3) Allow them to take pictures, but only from outside the perimeter. It’s fine for the press to
take pictures of your team members while they work, but don’t pose them for pictures.
 e. If official investigators (police, FAA, NTSB, county coroner or medical examiner, etc.) arrive:
 1) Determine their name and affiliation. Put it in the log.
 2) Once the official is identity is confirmed take the steps outlined in Task O-0804 - Sign Over a
Site.
 3) If they do not wish to take over the site (Often officials may not take over the site if a higher
official is known to be on the way. Some jurisdictions only allow shift supervisors or director level personnel to
receive custody from other agencies):
 (a) Escort them to the scene, and into it if they desire.
 (b) Remind them not to disturb wreckage. If they do, note it in the mission log with
before and after diagrams or photographs.
 f. Always, be polite and courteous.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: This task is normally tested in conjunction with O-0802 - Plan and Organize Site Surveillance. You let
the student use the plan he came up with for that task. If you area testing this task alone, prepare a mock crash
site. Mark the wreck, any safety hazards and the perimeter. Prepare a written plan for surveillance, using the
task P-0202 as a guide. Provide the team leader with 6-10 personnel with field gear to act as the ground team.
Post 2 or 3 of them in a hasty perimeter around the site.
Brief Team Leader: Tell the student that he is the team leader and has been assigned to secure this crash site.
Brief him on the plan using the format in Task P-0202 (or to use the plan he developed when being tested on
Task P-0202. Tell him that all survivors have been evacuated, and there is currently no one on site. Tell him he
has already established a hasty perimeter (the 2 or 3 members you posted), but that they have received no
briefing. Inform him that he may use any checklist, including this book, that he carries in his field gear. Tell
him to perform all actions necessary to post his rest relief and begin surveillance.. Tell him to you will play the
role bystanders, intruders, and mission base. Finally, tell the team leader that the first relief must be in position
in 1 hour.

SIGN OVER A SITE
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a team that is conducting site surveillance. An outside agency or another CAP ground team
arrives on site to relieve you.
## OBJECTIVES
Correctly brief your replacement, assist in posting their sentries (as needed) and sign over control of the site.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Once you take control of a site, you cannot leave it without formally relinquishing control. Normally, this is
done by turning the site over to another CAP Ground Team, or to an outside agency such as the police or the
FAA. In either case, you also want to get permission for the relief from the mission coordinator.
 a. If you are being relieved by another ground team, you should brief them, help post their first relief,
and then sign the site over in both team’s mission logs.
 b. If you are being relieved by an outside agency, the procedure is similar, except the signing over is
more formal. Also, most agencies will not be posting sentries as CAP does.
2. To turn over control to another CAP Ground Team:
 a. Get permission from the mission coordinator.
 b. Brief the new team leader (and his team, if he desires) on:
 1) The aircraft.
 2) Any safety hazards in the area.
 3) Your plan for surveillance including your communications plan, sentry locations, bivouac
area, parking area, and command post.
 4) Significant events (from your log).
 5) Anything you expect to happen in the future. For example, “The FAA investigator called and
said he will be her tomorrow morning at 10:00.”
 c. Assist the new team leader in posting his first sentry shift (relief). Have your sentries brief his
sentries as they take over.
 d. Once the new team leader has posted his sentries, he initiates the sign over. Each team leader signs
the other team’s log entry, stating that you (state your name and rank) briefed him (state his name) and that he
assumes control of the crash site at this time. Remember, the new team leader initiates this. Until he says he is
assuming control, you cannot leave. 
O-0804 17-MAR-04
 e. The new team leader notifies mission base that he has assumed control.
2. To turn over control to a representative of an outside agency:
 a. Get the representative’s name and agency, and write them in the log.
 b. Get permission from the mission coordinator.
 c. Brief the representative new team leader on:
 1) The aircraft, victims, or other disaster remnants.
 2) Any safety hazards in the area.
 3) Significant events (from your log).
 4) Anything you expect to happen in the future. For example, “The FAA investigator called and
said he will be her tomorrow morning at 10:00.”
 d. Assist the agency representative in setting up any security he desires.
 e. Write the following or a similar entry in your log:
“ I ____(representative’s name)______________, representing _____(his organization)____,
hereby accept responsibility for the scene involving (victims' name, aircraft number, make,
model, fuselage and trim color, if known) I am releasing ___(your name)__of the Civil Air
Patrol from any further requirement to secure the site. I have been completely briefed by -
___(your name)____. I acknowledge that the scene appears to be in good order, and any
movement of wreckage, fatalities and/or parts thereof have been described to me.
 f. Have both you and the representative sign and date this log entry.
 e. Notify mission base that you have turned over control.

EXERCISE UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS
## CONDITIONS
In participating as a member of the CAP mission team, you encounter a patient that needs to be assessed and
possibly treated.
OJECTIVES
The student will take adequate action to protect himself from bloodborne pathogens utilizing universal
precautions while assessing and possibly treating the patient.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Universal Precautions is the concept that all blood and certain body fluids are to be treated as if
contaminated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or other bloodborne
pathogens
2. An acceptable alternative to Universal Precautions is Body Substance Isolation (the treating of all fluids and
substances as infectious).
3. Materials requiring universal precautions:
a. Blood

b. Semen
 c. Vaginal secretions
 d. Cerebrospinal fluid
 e. Synovial fluid
 f. Pleural fluid
 g. Any body fluid with visible blood
 h. Any unidentifiable body fluid
 i. Saliva from dental procedures
4. Materials not requiring universal precautions unless there is visible blood:
 a. Feces
 b. Nasal secretions

c. Sputum 
O-0902 17-MAR-04
 d. Sweat
 e. Tears
 f. Urine
 g. Vomitus
NOTE: Though not required, it be difficult for team members to determine if blood is present, and they should
exercise universal precautions if unsure to be safe.
5. Personal protective equipment like gloves and a mask must be used whenever you might be exposed to
blood or other potentially infectious materials. Rubber gloves and surgical masks create a basic barrier between
the provider and the survivor, and protects both from transmitting potentially harmful diseases. There are some
basic rules to follow in exercising Universal Precautions.
 a. When conducting a hands-on assessment of a patient, always wear rubber gloves, and if the potential
exists for airborne transmission or being splashed with blood or other pathogenic fluids, at least wear a surgical
mask and goggles or face shield.
 b. Change gloves between patients. This avoids the transmission of pathogens between patients.
 c. Use well-fitting, disposable, latex or vinyl gloves for any task involving exposure to blood and other
body fluids. Make sure extra pairs are available.
 d. Before putting on gloves, make sure they have no holes, cracks or tears.
 e. Change gloves if they become torn or dirty.
 f. Remove gloves by grasping the cuffs and pulling them off inside out.
 g. Use work gloves over latex gloves when working around broken glass or sharp surfaces - for instance
when removing a person from an auto wreck or crashed aircraft.
 h. Dispose of latex gloves in identifiable medical-waste containers.
i. Wash hands following removal of gloves. Handwashing is the best overall protective measure against
most communicable diseases. Wash your hands and other skin surfaces thoroughly with soap and running
water immediately after contact with blood or other body fluids. When running water is not available,
waterless, hand-wash substitutes should be used until a more thorough handwashing can be accomplished.
### Additional Information
More detailed information on this topic is available in Chapter 16 of the Ground Team Member & Leader
Reference Text.
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: The evaluator will moulage a patient for the student to assess. The patient should have formal signs of
trauma, preferably with "bleeding" wounds. If multiple patients are to be examined in a large group exercise,
insure that the provider changes gloves between patients. If only one patient is to be assessed, determine 
O-0902 17-MAR-04
verbally what the student would do if multiple patients needed to be assessed. More than one student can be
assessed at the same time, but a one-to-one ratio of evaluators to students is preferable.
Brief Student: The student will be briefed to perform a basic assessment of the patient utilizing training and
equipment required of all ground team members.

DIRECT TEAM ACTIONS AT MEETING POINT
## CONDITIONS
You are the leader of a GSAR team that has just been alerted for a mission. You have designated a place for
team members to meet and assemble for movement to the mission base. Your team members and the team
vehicles have just arrived.
## OBJECTIVES
Performs necessary inspections and organizes the team within 20 minutes.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. When the team leader arrives at the unit's meeting point prior to departing for mission base, certain actions
must be taken prior to departure. These actions will ensure the team readiness to participate on the mission and
ensure adequate contact is maintained with the home unit for communicating with family members of mission
personnel.
2. To accomplish this the team leader should take the following actions, in any order.
a. Complete two copies of the CAPF 109 for the entire team.
 b. Inspect each person for key equipment items. Before you take someone on a mission, you must
ensure that they have the minimum equipment needed to survive and be effective. This is not the same as a full
inspection; you’re merely checking for the basics. If anyone expected to be a member of the team does not
have these basic items, DON’T BRING THEM TO THE MISSION. Persons needed at mission base to perform
other duties with different equipment requirements may often travel with your team for convenience sake.
You’ll spend more time caring for their needs than searching for your target. Basic items include:
 1) Current CAP ID card and current CAPF 101 certifying the person as a Ground Team Member
or Ground Team Member Trainee.
 2) Appropriate clothing for the climate, for example proper uniform, orange safety vest, gloves
and coat in the winter time, etc.
 3) Appropriate food, water, sleeping gear, and shelter.
 4) Anything else you think is necessary (such as flashlights for night missions).
 5) For all vehicle drivers, (including those just driving to mission base) a valid state driver’s
license from any state is required. For corporate vehicles that will be used on the mission, the driver must
possess a valid CAP Driver’s license from any state in addition to a valid state driver's license.
 c. Ensure drivers complete vehicle safety inspections in accordance with CAPF 73 (Daily CAP Vehicle
Inspection Report). Don’t use any vehicle that fails the inspection without the permission of the Incident
Commander. This includes privately owed vehicles. 
O-1001 17-MAR-04
 d. Assign personnel to vehicles, and have the driver’s supervise the packing of personal equipment.
 e. Inspect critical team equipment. Check those items critical to the mission, to make sure you have
them and that they are functional. For example, maps, radios, distress beacon DF Kit, etc.
 f. Assign jobs to team members as necessary (Assistant Team Leader, team medic, navigator, and log
keeper, or radio operator for example).
 g. As time permits, start mission paperwork (CAPF 109, and ICSF 214).
h. Have the log keeper start the team log.
### Additional Information
More detailed information on this topic is available in Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of the Ground Team Member and
Leader Reference Text.
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Provide a ground team of at least four individuals with personal equipment, one ground team vehicle,
and copies of CAPF 73, CAPF 109, and ICSF 214. Have a stopwatch or timer. The person being tested may
use any part of their equipment, including this book, to perform the task.
Brief Team Leader: Tell the Team leader that his team has just assembled at the meeting point. Tell him what
sort of mission the team is going on (choose any that seem appropriate to the team’s equipment), and that he has
20 minutes to perform all necessary actions before moving to mission base.

 ESTABLISH A HELICOPTER LANDING ZONE
## CONDITIONS
You are leading a search team, and have been directed to prepare a helicopter landing zone. (LZ). It can be
either day or night.
## OBJECTIVES
Select a good site for the (LZ). Take the steps necessary to prepare it, and direct the helicopter in.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Occasionally, police, military or medevac helicopters may be working with CAP ground teams, especially for
search and evacuation. In these situations, ground teams may be called upon to select and prepare a landing
zone (LZ) for a helicopter.
2. To establish a helicopter landing zone:
 a. Whenever possible, establish radio communication with the pilot, and have him tell you what he
wants you to do.
 1) Follow his instructions, even if they differ from what is listed below.
 2) If you don’t have an appropriate radio, attempt to relay through someone who does
(policeman, mission base, CAP aircraft, etc.)
 b. Prepare the landing zone:
 1) The LZ must be large enough to allow for the helicopters approach, landing, and turn around.
 2) Attempt to find a large area that will permit a 15 degree approach and takeoff angle.
 3) Remember, the higher the barriers, the longer the LZ must be.
 4) Attempt to find the landing zone that is oriented with the long axis generally into the wind.
 5) Remember that wires are extremely difficult for the pilot to see when approaching the LZ.
 6) The touchdown zone must be free of obstacles that might damage the bottom of the
helicopter, that is, tree stumps, large rocks, etc.
 7) Remove all loose brush from areas that the helicopter may be landing in, hovering around, or
taking off from.
 8) Mark landing zones, if needed, with a signal panel (stake or weight it down to keep the rotors
from blowing it away). Indicate wind direction via streamers, smoke, etc. (don’t obscure the LZ with smoke!) 
O-1002 31-JAN-01
 9) Keep unauthorized personnel away!
 c. At night, do all the above, plus:
 1) Be especially aware of any hazards such as power lines, fences, trees, etc. that the pilot may
not be able to see.
 2) Park vehicles with low beams on approximately 40 to 50 feet from the helicopter landing
area, offset from the helicopter approach route. (see diagram below)
 3) Never shine lights at helicopter which may blind the pilot. 
O-1002 31-JAN-01
Helicopter Landing Zone

3. To direct the helicopter down.
 a. Whenever possible, establish radio communications with the pilot. Describe the landing zone, the
wind speed and direction (the direction the wind is coming from), and any obstacles.
 b. Get the pilot’s attention with signal panels, signal mirrors, waving, etc. Show him where the LZ is.
 c. If the pilot wishes, place a signal man at the upwind end of the LZ. The signal man should use the
hand signals listed in Attachment B of the Ground Team Member and Leader Reference Text. Only volunteer
this service if you have someone fully trained in the signals. Incorrect signals can be more damaging than no
signals at all. (The signal man should always wear eye protection).
 d. REMEMBER - The pilot is in charge. He is responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft. He has
a right to ignore anything you tell him, and land wherever he chooses. Your job is to help him according to his
wishes. He has landed that helicopter many more times than you have!
4. To approach or exit the helicopter.
 a. Wait for permission to board or exit from the pilot.
 b. Approach or leave the helicopter from near the front so the pilot can see you at all times. Never
approach from the rear 180 degrees.
 c. No smoking around the helicopter.
 d. Secure hats and other loose items to protect against rotor winds.
 e. Keep long-handled tools, litters, antennas and similar items away from rotor blades. 
O-1002 31-JAN-01
 f. Keep you head down at all times. The slower the rotor blades are turning, the lower they will dip
towards the ground.
 g. Never approach or leave a helicopter from any side where the ground is higher than where the
helicopter is standing, or you may walk into a rotor blade.

CONDUCT WITNESS INTERVIEW
## CONDITIONS
You have been informed that there is a person who may have knowledge about the location of the search target.
You have paper, pen or pencil, and a CAP Form 106.
## OBJECTIVE
Politely conduct the interview, via phone or in person, gathering all necessary information without confusing
the witness, and prepare a CAP Form 106 with the results of your interview.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Witness interviews can be the single most important source of information on a mission. Information from
witnesses can help the mission coordinator narrow the search area, allocate search resources, and even locate
the target.
 a. Witness interviews can occur in four different situations:
 1) A witness comes up to you and volunteers knowledge.
 2) Your team has been sent to interview a specific person or persons.
 3) Your team is sent out to question people in an area where the search target (person or plane)
might have been.
 4) You receive a phone call and take the interview.
 b. Witnesses may have all kinds of useful information, for example:
 1) If someone has seen the search target alive and well at a given time, it helps the mission
coordinator in determining where search target is not, which means less area to search. They may also have
seen where the target was headed, or even talked to the target.
 2) In the case of a lost plane, someone may have seen the plane in trouble, or seen or heard
indications of a crash.
 3) Witnesses such as hunters may have seen signs of the search target in the woods.
 c. When conducting a witness interview, you are gathering information to fill out a CAP Form 106
(Witness Interrogation Form). This form is designed for lost aircraft, but can be used for lost persons as well.
There are a variety of lost person forms available, though none are official CAP. Use these only when directed
by your team leader. 
O-1101 31-JAN-01
 d. It is extremely important to get only the facts out of the witness. Witnesses might give false
information because of faulty memories or a desire to please the interviewer. Do not offer any information
about the incident to the witness during the interview, as this might change their recollections.
 e. Whenever possible, use two personnel to conduct an interview. One asks questions and one takes
notes. More than two is intimidating, and does not help.
2. To conduct an interview:
 a. Prepare yourself. Make sure your uniform is worn correctly. Remove excess field gear, especially
anything that might bother the witness, such as large knives. "Clean up" before the interview, combing your
hair, washing off any dirt from the field. ENSURE YOUR BREATH IS FRESH -- you want your witness to
think about the search target, not your breath.
 b. Properly identify yourself as a CAP member. Show the witness your ID card, and some photo ID if
he asks. Let the witness know exactly what you are here to do.
 c. Conduct the interview in a comfortable location for the interviewee, preferably a living room or
family room. This area should also be relatively free of distractions.
 d. If the interviewee believes that he or she saw the search ## OBJECTIVE, then try to take them back to that
location. If that is not possible, have a map available.
 e. Questioning the witness:
 1) First, let the witness tell the story without you interrupting. Take notes. Then go back and
ask questions to make sure they cover everything. Control your body language while conducting the interview;
witnesses may unconsciously or purposefully change their story if the interviewer shows too much.
 2) DON’T LEAD THE WITNESS. Do not volunteer information that might alter their
recollection. For example, ask them what color the plane was. Do not ask “Was it blue?” They might agree
with you even though they do not really remember that detail.
 3) Do not hurry the witness, or press them for information they do not have. If they insist that
they do not know something, do not insist that they “make a guess.”
4) Show acceptance for what they have to say
 5) To probe an area of interest, restate their words or summarize what they said.
 6) If the witness says something that does not make sense, ask questions to verify what exactly
they witnessed.
 7) When interviewing children, be very wary of reliability. Question them thoroughly and ask
their parents about the child’s reliability, but be tactful since many parents would resent questioning their child's
honesty. It is often preferable to interview children without their parents present to avoid parental coaching, but
remember to get the parent's permission first.
 8) Ask questions that will give you confidence in their answers. In determining the time of the
event you might need to ask them how they know the time. In judging flight related items, be especially careful 
O-1101 31-JAN-01
to determine the interviewee's knowledge of the subject. How did the interviewee know how high the plane
was flying? Is the interviewee a pilot, or does he or she have aviation experience?
 9) In a good interview, the witness does most of the talking.
 10) At the end of the interview, review the answers given. This allows you correct any errors
made, and the witness could relate new information not previously discussed.
 e. Use the CAP Form 106 as a guide. You may want to show the form to the witness so they are not
intimidated by it. You can write directly on the form or take notes on paper. Either way, you will need to
prepare a legible copy of the 106 after the interview. You probably will not be able to fill in the form from top
to bottom -- the witness might There are advantages and disadvantages to the interviewee filling out the form.
It allows them to express what they mean directly, but could hinder the free flow of information encouraged
between the interviewer and the interviewee. The 106 is self explanatory for the most part, but a few of the
blocks require comment:
 1) Block 9 (Telephone). The telephone number of the witness where he can be contacted later.
If he has a work and home number, put them both in block 9.
 2) Block 10 (Estimated Age). Estimate the age of the person, do not ask them. Some people do
not want to state their age.
 3) Block 14 (What occurrence fixed time he heard/saw plane?). If the person said he saw the
plane at 1400, ask him how he is sure of that. If he looked at his watch, then it probably was 1400. If he looked
at his watch at 1300, and about an hour later he saw the plane, then he might be off on his time estimate. This
sort of information is very important to know. If the witness was watching television or listening to the radio it
may be easier for the witness to relate what was playing, and you can get at least a rough time of airing from the
broadcasting station.
 4) Block 17 (About how high above the ground was it?) and Block 18 (About how far away
was it at the nearest point?) Most people will not be very accurate at this. Ask them how they figured the

KEEP A LOG
## CONDITIONS
You have been assigned to keep a log on a mission, and must log the actions of your unit, section or team on the
ICS Form 214 for use during debrief after the mission.
OJECTIVES
Correctly maintain a log of actions during an incident.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline

1. When working an incident, staff members are required to maintain a log of all significant actions. This is
important for record keeping of the accomplishments and setbacks, determining search effectiveness during
debriefing, and as a legal record of CAP actions amongst many other things.
2. The mission log is started once a unit or section is opened and maintained until personnel are called in and at
home safely to the incident commander. A separate log should be maintained for each varying unit or section
that is assigned to the incident, and subordinate units at varying levels will normally also keep a log. This log is
turned in with the debriefing paperwork and becomes part of the official mission record.
3. The following actions are always recorded in the log:
FOR GROUND OPERATIONS
 a. Departure and return times to mission base.
 b. Routes taken to and from the search area.
 c. Times of entering and leaving search areas.
 d. Any time the search line changes direction.
 e. Times/locations of clue detections or witness interviews.
 f. Time/location of find.
 g. Time/Location of communications checks.
 h. Any event or action related to the team's ability to complete the sortie requirements (natural hazards
encountered, injuries to team members, etc.).
 i. Encounters or instructions from local authorities.
 j. Encounters with the media.
 k. Mileage/Flight time at key intersections, when leaving pavement, at other key locations, etc. 
P-0101 17-MAR-04

CONDUCT PHONE ALERT
## CONDITIONS
You are a member of a ground team, and receive a phone call at home alerting you for a mission.
OJECTIVES
Take the steps necessary to alert all the personnel you are responsible for on the alert roster, passing on all the
necessary information.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Alerting the team is the first step to saving a life. Done correctly, the phone alert quickly notifies all
members of the team that a mission is in progress, gives them the information they need to prepare for the
mission and move to the team meeting place, and informs the team leader of who will be attending the mission.
 a. You squadron should have an alert roster, which graphically designates who calls who in the event of
an alert. The roster will look something like this:
 With this diagram, it is easy to see who calls who in an alert. 1st Lt. Smith calls 2nd. Lt. Jones and Cadet
Brown. 2nd Lt. Jones calls S/M Green. Cadet Brown calls Cadets Doe and White. Cadet Doe calls Cadet
1st Lt. Smith
555-1111
2nd Lt. Jones
555-2222
C/FO Brown
555-3333
C/SSgt. Doe
555-4444
C/Sgt. White
555-5555
S/M Green
555-6666
C/Amn Black
555-4444
C/Amn Cook
555-7777
C/B Davis
555-8888
P-0102 31-JAN-01
Black. Cadet White calls Cadet Cook, who in turn calls Cadet Davis. This chart also assumes that 1st Lt. Smith
is the squadron commander. If for some reason the squadron commander is not the main POC for missions in
the unit, then the commander should be notified that the squadron has been alerted.
 b. The team leader or designated individual must ensure the alert roster is kept up to date as members
leave or join the team.
 c. When a team leader starts the alert by “calling down the alert roster," he or she needs feedback. The
personnel on the alert roster must confirm that they have passed the information on to those they were supposed
to call, report on whom they could not reach, and report who will be attending the mission. This last piece of
information can be critically important in determining how much transportation is needed. Accomplishing this
can be done one of two ways. First, when the people at the bottom of the roster have been called, the people
who called them should call back UP the roster, telling the person who called them, whom they contacted,
whom they did not contact, and who will be attending the mission. Second, last member notified in the chain
contacts the squadron POC initiating the alert (in this case probably 1st Lt. Smith) before departing for the
meeting place with the same information.
 d. The biggest problem with alert rosters occurs when you cannot reach someone you are supposed to
call. If this happens, you must take responsibility for calling all the personnel that person was supposed to call.
If you do not, those personnel will never be alerted.
2. When you receive an alert call:
 a. Ensure the person tells you (at a minimum):

 1. Type of Mission
 2. Expected Duration of Mission
 3. Time and Location of Meeting Place
 4. Any special instructions.
 5. Mission number
 6. Their call back number
 b. Write down all this information. Do not trust your memory.
 c. Call those people directly below you on the alert roster. If one of those people is not available, call all
the people that person would call. (if you could not reach them because of a busy signal, make sure to try again
later.) Pass on all the information. Find out if they will be able to attend the mission.
 d. If the personnel you call are at the bottom of the roster, after you call them, call the person who
called you or the alerting officer and report who you reached, who you did not reach, and who will be attending
as advised during your alert briefing.
 e. If the personnel you call have other people to call, wait until they call you back with their report.
Then call and report to the person who called you.
 f. Keep conversations short and keep the phone line open as much as possible. Someone may be trying
to call you with a report or an update to the information.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Prepare an alert roster and give a copy to the student.
Brief Student: Show the student where he is on the roster (it does not have to really be his name. Just ensure
that the name you pick is someone in the middle of the roster). Tell the student that you will simulate an alert
call, and that the student should take all necessary actions, including simulating the calling of all the personnel
that they should call on the list. Tell him that you will play the role of anyone he calls. Then “call” the member
and pretend to alert them for the mission. Ensure you leave out one of the required elements of the alert call
(listed in paragraph 2 above). When they simulate calling others, have one of those people not be home.

SIGN-IN GROUND SEARCH TEAM AT MISSION
## CONDITIONS
You are the leader of a ground team that has just arrived at mission base. You have completed a individual and
vehicle accountability and safety inspection.
## OBJECTIVES
Complete personnel and vehicle sign-in within 15 minutes of arriving at mission base.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. Before a team can depart mission base to perform a sortie, the team leader is responsible for ensuring that all
personnel are properly “signed-in” to the mission. This should be done immediately upon arrival at mission
base. Signing-in gives the mission staff information on what vehicle and personnel resources are available, and
it gives the ground operations staff specific information on team composition and capability. Legally, it also
ensures that all personnel and vehicles on the mission are accounted for and are covered by the appropriate
insurance regulations.
 a. There are three forms used to sign-in a team - team leaders should have copies of these forms onhand.
 1) ICS Form 211, Check-In List - used to record all personnel or teams present at the mission,
along with several other critical peeves of information. For this reason, it is essential that everyone writes
legibly on the form.
 2) ICS Form 218, Support Vehicle Inventory – used by the ground support unit of the logistics
section to record all ground support vehicles (corporate and private) participating in the mission. This includes
vehicles that only transport people to the mission base and aren’t expected to be used during the mission. This
form is used primarily for insurance, reimbursement, and letting the mission staff know what assets are
available.
 3) CAPF-109, Vehicle Clearance Form - used to plan and brief all ground team sorties assigned
during a mission.
 b. Teams can actually begin the sign in process before arriving at mission base. A team leader can have
his team fill out the paperwork at the meeting point, or while en route.
2. To sign in a team for a mission:
 a. Have your team members complete an ICS Form 211. As they do this, ensure that:
 1) Each member has on-hand a current CAP ID card and CAPF 101 for the job they will be
doing. (normally, inspect this yourself. For large teams, delegate the inspection to your second-in-command.
 2) Each member writes legibly, providing his appropriate information (listing Trainee status if
applicable). 
P-0201 17-MAR-04
 3) Emergency contact information should be on file, but may need to be provided. Ensure that
someone is known who can actually be reached during the mission if something happens to you.
 b. Have all drivers complete the ICS Form 218, providing the required information.
 c. Fill out a CAPF 109. It is often good to do this as each person is logged onto the 211. This way, you
can question them on their qualifications and check any qualification cards at the same time you’re checking
CAP ID’s and 101 cards.
 1) Only list personnel who will be part of your ground team. If you transported people to the
mission who will be working mission staff, base operations, aircrew, etc., don’t list them on the form. Also
don’t list people who don’t have at least a Ground Team Member Trainee Rating - GES personnel cannot be
part of a ground team.
 2) Fill in all required information on your vehicles, communications resources. For each team
member, indicate each person's name, list each member's ground operations specialties, and their personal
equipment.
 3) List all the items of team equipment your team has, and what vehicle it is located in. Have
your drivers fill in the safety checklist for all team vehicles.
 4) Turn one copy of the form in to the Ground Branch Director and make one for yourself.
 5) During the mission, people will often be added or taken from your team and assignments may
change. When this happens, you should immediately update the CAPF 109 with the Ground Branch Director.

P-0201 17-MAR-04
### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: Ensure you have provided the team leader with an ICS Form 211, ICS form 218, CAPF 109, and a pen.
Prepare a sheet containing all necessary information on two ground team vehicles (including equipment in each
vehicle) and 6 team members (including name, age, senior/cadet status, what vehicles they are driving/riding in,
and the qualifications they have). Ensure there is at least one person on the list with only a GES or other nonground team rating. Prepare a second sheet describing two other team members from a different squadron.
Brief Team Leader:
1. Give the team leader the CAP Forms listed above, and the information on the vehicles and the six
team members. Tell him that he has just arrived at mission base, and has inspected his vehicles and equipment,
and that the handouts describe what assets and personnel his team have. Tell him that you will act as a team
member just attached to his team. Tell him that he has 15 minutes to correctly:
 a. Have himself and you sign in on the ICS Form 211.
 b. Complete the ICS Form 218 for all vehicles.
 c. Complete the CAPF 109 for all team members.
 2. After the team leader has completed this task, tell him that at the end of the day, one member of his
team (choose a name), is assigned to work at mission base for the rest of the mission, and that two members
from another squadron have been added to the team (give him the sheet describing the two team members).
Tell the team leader to update the paperwork as needed.

PLAN AND BRIEF SORTIE
## CONDITIONS
You are the leader of a ground team that has just been given a sortie briefing.
## OBJECTIVES
Within 5 minutes, issue a warning order to your team. Within 20 minutes, correctly issue an operations order.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. The key to a successful mission is a usable plan. The team leader makes this plan for his unit. There are
three types of orders. All of these are normally given verbally.
 a. The Warning Order is designed to save time. It lets your team know what preparations to make
while you are preparing your plan. That way, they’re not waiting around for you to finish the plan before they
do anything. It consists of four items of information:
 1. Type of Sortie - what, roughly, is your team about to do (line search, witness interview, etc.)
 2. Preparations to begin - for example “pack up the van, check out the distress beacon DF gear.”
 3. Earliest Time of Movement - when the team will leave. This lets them know how long they
have for preparations.
 4. Attachments and Detachments - if anyone is joining the team (for example another squadron,
a police dog team, etc.) and if anyone is leaving your team.
 5. Time and Place of Operations Order - When and where the team should gather for you to
brief your operations order.
 b. The Operations Order tells your team what you’re about to do, and how to do it. Normally, it’s
given orally, and team members copy it down in their notebooks. The operations order uses five paragraphs,
which are:
 1) Paragraph 1 - Situation - information on the search target, other search elements in the area,
and terrain and weather.
 2) Paragraph 2 - Mission - exactly what your team is about to do. Written as a few quick
sentences, answering the questions Who, what, where, when and why.
 3) Paragraph 3 - Execution - exactly how your team will accomplish the mission, in detail.
 a) This paragraph starts off with the Ground Branch Director’s Intent, which is a
statement of exactly what the GBD. wants you to accomplish. In a line search, for example, there’s a big
difference between “This is the best lead we have. I want you to go over that area with a fine tooth comb until 
P-0202 17-MAR-04
you reach 80% probability” and “The police are about to call off the search. Cover as much ground as you can
in the next two hours.” Each of these intents will result in a very different plan.
 b) The rest of the paragraph is the Concept of Execution, which covers how the team will
move, what each person’s job is, what team equipment each should carry, how you will search, what you will
do when you find the target, etc. Describe, in sequence, exactly what you plan to do.
 4) Paragraph 4 - Service Support - how you will support yourselves in the field. What food you
should take, where the nearest medical assistance is, whether you should plan on being in the search area
overnight, what equipment checks and maintenance should the team do before it leaves.
 5) Paragraph 5 - Command and Signal - everything about the communications plan, including
frequencies, radio check-in times, key phone numbers, whistle signals, etc. Also reviews the chain of command
for the team and the mission, and states where the team leader will be located during the mission.
 c. A Fragmentary Order is simply an update to an operations order. For example, once you arrive at
the search area, you may change your mine about how you plan to search it. There is no special format. Just use
the operations order format, but only brief those items that change.
2. To ensure you come up with a workable plan, follow the Troop Leading Procedure listed below:
 a. Receive the Mission. Get the sortie brief from the Ground Branch. Start thinking about what you
want to do.
 b. Issue a Warning Order - this gets your team started in preparing for the operations.
 c. Make a Tentative Plan - sit down with a map, and start your plan.
 d. Initiate Movement - if time is of the essence, start driving/walking to the search area.
 e. Conduct Reconnaissance - when possible, look at the ground you will be walking. If not, use a map.
 f. Complete the Plan
 g. Issue the Operations Order
 h. Supervise - and revise the plan as necessary with Fragmentary Orders.

4. The Operations Order Format: Use the following checklist to make sure you cover everything during your
operations order brief. Make sure to use visual aids like maps and diagrams when you brief, if they will help
your team to understand. The best place to brief is at the search area, where the team can see what the terrain
looks like.

CONDUCT REHEARSALS
## CONDITIONS
You are the leader of a ground team that has just been given a sortie briefing. You have completed your plan
and briefed your team.
## OBJECTIVES
Conduct a rehearsal of the key activities you expect to perform on your mission.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. A rehearsal is the act or process of practicing an action in preparation for the actual performance of that
action. Often, your team will be given tasks to perform that require rehearsal. For example, you may be
ordered to perform a night line search, and your team has some members who have never done it before. So,
before you get out in the woods, it’s best to rehearse how you will perform that search - how you’ll keep
interval on the line, how you’ll mark your path, how you’ll maintain your direction of movement, etc.
 a. Rehearsals are much better than just briefing a mission. The rehearsal leaves a lasting mental picture
in everyone’s mind of what’s going to happen, and what part they play in it.
 b. Rehearsals are also a great place to practice contingency, or “what if” drills. For instance, during a
rehearsal you could ask a team member to demonstrate what he would do if he found a clue, found the victim,
or became lost.
 c. Team rehearsals take two major forms.
 1) In a “full up” rehearsal, the team rehearses exactly what they’ll do, using all their equipment,
just as if they were actually doing it. So, before starting the night search listed above, the team leader would
form his team members in a field or wooded area, and actually practice moving, searching and marking.
 2) You can also hold a simulated or “sand table” rehearsal. In this case, you set up a model of
the area, either by drawing in the dirt, or using a map or drawing. Then you talk your way through the
operation, letting each person describe what actions they will take. You can use rocks or other markers to
simulate each team member, and have them move them along the ground.
2. To perform a rehearsal:
 a. Decide what to rehearse - this requires determining:
 1) How much time you have available. If you must begin the sortie in 5 minutes, you won’t have
time to rehearse very much. If you have an hour, you can do a much more thorough job.
 2) What parts of the operation require rehearsal. You want to rehearse the parts of the sortie that
are complicated, or unfamiliar to your team. You especially want to rehearse the key events - the things that
would “make or break” the operation. If the sortie is a line search, and your team is very proficient at line 
P-0203 31-JAN-01
searching, there’s no reason to rehearse that. But if your team hasn’t practiced what it would do if you found
the victim, this would be a good time to go over that.
 b. Decide what type of rehearsal - “full up” or simulated. This is mainly based on how much time you
have. “Full up” rehearsals are preferable, but often impractical. At the very least, a ground team can conduct a
verbal rehearsal of key events while driving to the sortie location (if not required to perform a mounted search
en route).
 c. Prepare the rehearsal area. For a “full up” rehearsal, this means choosing a place to rehearse. For a
simulated, this means preparing the terrain model. As stated above, you can create a miniature version of the
terrain on the ground, or use sketches or maps. The bigger the model, the better.
 b. Conduct the rehearsal.
 1) Overview. Remind the team what the sortie is. Then tell them what you’re going to rehearse,
and in what sequence.
 2) Orientation. Orient the team to the terrain or model being used. For example “The terrain
model represents the search area. North is to your right. This line I’ve drawn represents the highway. The large
black rock is the Ranger Station.” Always ask for questions, to make sure everyone understands.
 3) Walk Through. Walk the team through the operation. Have them demonstrate and describe
what actions they will take. Ask “what if” questions, such as “Smith, at this point you come across a 15 foot
wide stream blocking your path. What will you do?”. These make sure everyone understands the operation.
 4) Summary of Changes. Often, you will make changes in your plan during the operation. For
example, you might not want Jones to be your compass man, because it was obvious from the rehearsal that
he’s not proficient enough. If you make changes, make sure everyone understands them.
 5) Ask for questions.

### Evaluation Preparation
Setup: (This task is normally tested along with P-0202 - Plan and Brief Sortie. If you test it this way, simply
have the team leader rehearse his planned sortie. Otherwise, use the following preparation instructions).
Choose a type of sortie, such as line search, mounted search, crash site surveillance, ramp check, etc., and
prepare an operations order for the sortie (see task P-0202). Choose the part of the task you want the team
leader to rehearse, using task name(s) from the ground team member and leaders handbook. Right them down
on a sheet of paper. Decide what kind of rehearsal you want the leader to do (full up or sandtable). Provide
team members for the rehearsal. Pre brief the team members on the plan.
Brief Team Leader: Tell the team leader that he/she should conduct a rehearsal of the tasks you have chosen.
Brief the team leader using the Operations Order Format from task P-0202. Tell him he may use anything he
carries in his field gear, including this book. Explain the sortie to the team leader, and give him his team

CONDUCT AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW
## CONDITIONS
You are the leader of a ground team that has just completed a sortie, either actual or training. Debrief and team
refit are complete. You now wish to review the team’s performance to determine future training requirements.
## OBJECTIVE
Successfully conduct a review that fosters individual participation, and determines the team’s training strengths
and weaknesses with respect to the sortie conducted. Records the results of the review for use in planning
future training.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
### Training Outline
1. The After Action Review, or review, is a group activity that allows all members of the group to work
together to review a mission sortie or training event. The purpose is to determine those things the team does
well (and should sustain) and those things the team needs to improve in.
2. The review is a group process. If the leader just stands up and tells everyone else what happened, and no one
else talks, it is not a review -- it’s just a lecture.
3. The review is more than just a group discussion. The leader facilitates the review by leading a discussion of
the events and activities that focuses on the training ## OBJECTIVEs. The discussion should orient on what the team
did, what the members did, and what the leaders did, relating these actions to the outcome of the mission and to
training ## OBJECTIVEs (such as the tasks in this book). This discussion should also address the functionality of
equipment used by the team. At the close, the review leader summarizes the discussion, covering strengths and
weaknesses discussed during the review and what the team needs to do to fix the weaknesses.
4. The leader must make sure the discussion focuses on what the team did, not what higher headquarters or
other units did. Remember, the purpose is to help train your unit -- not someone else’s.
5. To successfully conduct a review, the leader must:
 a. PLAN.
 1) Establish ## OBJECTIVEs for the review -- what do you want to accomplish? If your unit just
completed a Crash Site Surveillance sortie, then your main ## OBJECTIVE would be to review the conduct of the
surveillance. If you had more time, you might also wish to review how the team alert and the drive to the site
went. You decide on the ## OBJECTIVEs prior to the review, and keep the discussion within those ## OBJECTIVEs.
 2) Choose the review Site -- pick a place that is comfortable, with adequate light, and protection
from the elements if possible. Reviews should not be conducted with the team standing in formation -- it will
quickly turn in to a lecture.
 3) Select Training Aids -- determine what “props” you need. A map is always handy. A
blackboard or white board can be used to draw pictures of how the team moved through an area, or to record the 
P-0204 17-MAR-04
results of the review. You should always have the appropriate publications on hand (ground team handbook,
CAPM 50-15, etc.) that discuss the correct way of doing whatever the team just did.
 b. PREPARE
 1) Review The Training ## OBJECTIVEs And ## OBJECTIVEs - Write down what the purpose of the
exercise was. (For example “To practice hasty search and first aid”). Then look through your reference
publications to make sure you know what the ## OBJECTIVEs are.
 2) Review your notes and the team log- If you took any notes during the exercise or sortie,
review them to refresh you memory as to what happened (or at least what you observed -- other team members
may add things during the review that you never noticed).
 3) Develop an outline -- decide on how you want to lead your team through the discussion.
Base your outline on this one:
 a) Introduction
 b) Present the Mission - What was your team supposed to do. Use the sortie briefing.
 c) Summary of Events -- What happened, chronologically, during the sortie?
 d) Discussion of Key Issues -- the things that made the mission a success (or failure).
 e) Analysis -- in terms of:
 - Command -- Was direction from upper echelons apparent? Did command staff
members assist teams in completing tasks as necessary?
 - Operations -- Was the appropriate resource used for the task? If combined
resources were necessary to complete the tasks assigned, was coordination of those resources effective? Did the
mission assignments meet the original intent as briefed?
 - Planning -- Were all resources assigned prepared for their tasks? Were team
assignments made effectively?
 - Finance and Administration -- Was documentation of team participation
readily apparent? Were reimbursement procedures briefed, if applicable?
 - Logistics Support -- Did the team have all of the necessary equipment to
accomplish the missions assigned? Was the communications system utilized effective? If teams were in the
field for an extended period, were items needed for refit of the team coordinated effectively?
 f) Discussion of the Suggested Training to Sustain or Improve Team Skills.
 g) Conclusion
 c. EXECUTE.
 1. Make sure everyone is comfortable. If people are uncomfortable or distracted, they will not
participate. 
P-0204 17-MAR-04
 2. Lead the discussion with questions. For example, if you have noted that had problems
maintaining a good search pattern during the sortie, don’t just tell the team that. Instead, ask something like
“What happened when we started our line search?” or “How well do you think our line search went?”.
Whenever possible, let the team members tell YOU how things went, not the other way around. The less you
talk, the better.
 3. Keep the group focused. If team members start talking about things not related to the sortie,
or the training ## OBJECTIVEs, it is your job to bring them back on track.
 4. Analyze what the group is saying. If something went wrong (or right) find out why. Discuss
how you could have done things better. Determine what training could help your team to improve.
 5. Do not embarrass anyone. Make sure everyone feels free to bring up problems without being
ridiculed. This is a sensitive issue, since you want team members to discuss their own mistakes. Everyone
must understand that the purpose of the review is to make the team better.
 6. Ensure performance is graded. By the end of the review, team members must clearly
understand what was good, bad and average about their performance. The art of the review is to get the team
members to accurately grade their own performance. In some cases, however, you may need to tell the team
how they did -- especially with newer members.
 7. Record the major points of the review, especially what areas need improvement. Use this
information to plan future training.

EMPLOY APPROPRIATE RADIO FREQUENCIES AND REPEATERS
## CONDITIONS
You are the radio operator for a ground team, and have been told by the team leader to contact another station.
You must choose what frequency to use.
## OBJECTIVE
Within 2 minutes, identify the appropriate frequencies and channels used for ground operations.
## TRAINING AND EVALUATION
Training Information Outline
1. Ground Search and Rescue Teams use a number of VHF-FM frequencies to communicate with mission base,
other ground teams, and aircraft.
2. Frequency assignments are usually given by the communications unit leader based on the following.
 a. Simplex Frequencies (VHF-FM): Short range communications where units are operating on the same
transmit and receive frequency
 b. Duplex Frequencies. Longer range communications are accomplished through the use of a repeater.
All repeaters are accessed by transmitting a subaudible tone through the radio. The 100.0 Hz tone will activate
any CAP repeater, but is used only in emergencies and to request the proper tone frequency for the repeater in
use. Other tones are programmed into the radio as required. The communications unit leader will brief teams on
what frequency and tones to use to access local repeaters.
 c. VHF-AM (Airband) SAR Frequencies: These are dedicated frequencies authorized for training and
actual missions that can be accessed by any aircraft.
 d. National HF Frequencies: These are frequencies coordinated by National Headquarters. Some teams
may be deployed with HF radios on these frequencies during disasters to serve as relay points out of affected
areas.
 e. Region HF Frequencies: These are frequencies established for HF operations within a region. Teams
may also be deployed and operate on these frequencies to transmit greater distances than traditional VHF-FM
assets used by ground teams.
 f. Other frequencies are used to communicate with police, Coast Guard, and other SAR agencies. Again,
the communications unit leader will brief on the use of these frequencies.
### Additional Information 
L-0003 17-MAR-04
### Additional Information on frequencies used in CAP and repeater locations can be found in CAPR 100-1 Vol. 1,
chapters 7, 9, & 10, and The Communications Directory. Wing Communications Operations and Training plans
will also contain important information for your area.
### Evaluation Preparation
