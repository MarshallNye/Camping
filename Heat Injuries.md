# Heat Injuries

Heat Injuries (sometimes called heat stress) are the result of overexertion and dehydration. These conditions can occur at any time during the year, but are most common during the summer months with high temperatures and humidity.

## Preventing Heat Stress
1. Ensure you are drinking enough water per day. Two quarts per day is the absolute minimum on a mild day. On a hot summer day, drink 6-8 quarts a day or 1 quart an hour. Frequent sipping is better than trying to drink an entire quart at a time.
2. Monitor the color of your urine. It should be almost clear in color. If it is brown or dark yellow, you are becoming dehydrated.
3. Wear loose fitting and open clothing.
4. Do not overexert yourself. Know your limits and do not exceed them. Take frequent breaks.
5. Avoid sunburn by using sunscreen or keeping your sleeves down.
6. Watch other members of the team for beginning signs of heat stress. Immediately stop, rest and drink some water. Once a person succumbs to a heat injury, he will not be back for the rest of the day.
7. Use the buddy system -- assign everyone a partner to watch for heat stress and to monitor water intake.

## Heat Injuries 
### Heat Cramps
Heat cramps are usually the first stage of heat stress. They are the result of dehydration and loss of
electrolytes in body tissues.

#### Symptoms of heat cramps
1. Severe muscle cramps, usually in the legs and abdomen.   
2. General Weakness
3. Sometimes dizziness and faintness.

#### Treatment of heat cramps
1. Move the patient to a cool, shady place.
2. Provide salted water or a commercial electrolyte (i.e. Gatorade).
3. Massage the cramped area.
4. Apply some pressure to the cramped area, but stop if it makes the patient more uncomfortable.
5. Apply moist towels to the patient’s forehead and the cramped muscle.
6. If symptoms worsen, immediately transport the person to a medical care facility.
 
### Heat exhaustion
Heat exhaustion is the next phase of heat stress (although some individuals may never develop heat cramps before going into heat exhaustion).

#### Symptoms of heat exhaustion
1. Rapid and shallow breathing.
2. Weak pulse.
3. Cold and clammy skin.
4. Heavy perspiration
5. Weakness and dizziness that may lead to unconsciousness

#### Treatment of heat exhaustion:
1. Move the patient to a cool, shady place and keep him at rest.
2. Remove enough clothing to cool (not chill) the patient.
3. Fan the patient’s skin to promote sweat evaporation.
4. If the patient is conscious, provide salted water or a commercial electrolyte (i.e.Gatorade).
5. Treat for shock and transport the patient to a medical care facility.
 
### Heat Stroke
 Heat Stroke is the final phase of heat stress. It is a life-threatening condition. It is the result of the body’s absolute failure to regulate heat, and as a result the bodies core temperature starts to rise hyperthermia). This leads to the rapid destruction of body tissues and brain cells. Permanent brain damage and death are possible outcomes of heat stroke. Even if successfully treated, it will take days for the patient to recover.

#### Symptoms of heat stroke
1. Deep breathing becoming progressively shallower.
2. A rapid, strong pulse becoming weaker.
3. Dry and hot skin
4. Dilated pupils.
5. Possible unconsciousness, seizures, and muscular twitching.
 
#### Treatment of heat stroke
1. key is to cool the patient as rapidly as possible.
2. Remove the person from any heat sources and remove clothing.
3. If possible immerse the patient in cool water, or use cold wet towels or ice packs in the patient’s armpits, groin, under neck and behind knees..
4. Treat for shock and transport the patient to a medical care facility.
